	abstract = {We report on the existing connection between power-law distributions and allometries. As it was first reported in Gomez-Lievano et al. (2012) for the relationship between homicides and population, when these urban indicators present asymptotic power-law distributions, they can also display specific allometries among themselves. Here, we present an extensive characterization of this connection when considering all possible pairs of relationships from twelve urban indicators of Brazilian cities (such as child labor, illiteracy, income, sanitation and unemployment). Our analysis reveals that all our urban indicators are asymptotically distributed as power laws and that the proposed connection also holds for our data when the allometric relationship displays enough correlations. We have also found that not all allometric relationships are independent and that they can be understood as a consequence of the allometric relationship between the urban indicator and the population size. We further show that the residuals fluctuations surrounding the allometries are characterized by an almost constant variance and log-normal distributions.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Multineuron firing patterns are often observed, yet are predicted to be rare by models that assume independent firing. To explain these correlated network states, two groups recently applied a second-order maximum entropy model that used only observed firing rates and pairwise interactions as parameters (Schneidman et al., 2006; Shlens et al., 2006). Interestingly, with these minimal assumptions they predicted 90–99\% of network correlations. If generally applicable, this approach could vastly simplify analyses of complex networks. However, this initial work was done largely on retinal tissue, and its applicability to cortical circuits is mostly unknown. This work also did not address the temporal evolution of correlated states. To investigate these issues, we applied the model to multielectrode data containing spontaneous spikes or local field potentials from cortical slices and cultures. The model worked slightly less well in cortex than in retina, accounting for 88 ± 7\% (mean ± {SD}) of network correlations. In addition, in 8 of 13 preparations, the observed sequences of correlated states were significantly longer than predicted by concatenating states from the model. This suggested that temporal dependencies are a common feature of cortical network activity, and should be considered in future models. We found a significant relationship between strong pairwise temporal correlations and observed sequence length, suggesting that pairwise temporal correlations may allow the model to be extended into the temporal domain. We conclude that although a second-order maximum entropy model successfully predicts correlated states in cortical networks, it should be extended to account for temporal correlations observed between states.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The imposition of a cost constraint for constructing the optimal navigation structure surely represents a crucial ingredient in the design and development of any realistic navigation network. Previous works have focused on optimal transport in small-world networks built from two-dimensional lattices by adding long-range connections with Manhattan length r ij taken from the distribution P ij ∼ r −α ij , where α is a variable exponent. It has been shown that, by introducing a cost constraint on the total length of the additional links, regardless of the strategy used by the traveler (independent of whether it is based on local or global knowledge of the network structure), the best transportation condition is obtained with an exponent α = d + 1, where d is the dimension of the underlying lattice. Here we present further support, through a high-performance real-time algorithm, on the validity of this conjecture in three-dimensional regular as well as in two-dimensional critical percolation clusters. Our results clearly indicate that cost constraint in the navigation problem provides a proper theoretical framework to justify the evolving topologies of real complex network structures, as recently demonstrated for the networks of the {US} airports and the human brain activity.},

Such a limit is characterized by a critical probability of creating packages pc, where above this value a transition to a congested state occurs. Moreover, pc is found to follow a power law, pc∼L-γ, where L is the network size. Our results indicate the presence of an optimal value of αmin≈1.7, where the parameter γ reaches its minimum value and the networks are more resilient to congestion for larger system sizes. Interestingly, this value is close to the analytically found value of α for the optimal navigation of single packages in spatially embedded networks, where αopt=d. Finally, we show that the power spectrum for the number of packages navigating the network at a given time step t, which is related to the divergence of the expected delivery time, follows a universal Lorentzian function, regardless of the topological details of the networks.},

First, we identify regions that show a high incidence of dengue cases and mosquito larvae in different years and analyze their corresponding correlations. We find that the characteristic correlation length of the epidemic is at least of the order of the system size, suggesting that factors such as citizen mobility may play a significant role in driving the spatial spread of the disease. We also find that in epidemic years, spatial correlations are substantially higher with a distribution skewed towards large values than non-epidemic years. Inspired by this observation, we perform a mean-field estimation of the basic reproduction number and find that the estimated values agree well with the values reported for other regions in Brazil and other countries, pointing towards similar underlying spreading mechanisms. These findings provide insights into the spreading characteristics of dengue in densely populated areas and may be relevant for improving disease containment strategies.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The size of cities is known to play a fundamental role in social and economic life. Yet, its relation to the structure of the underlying network of human interactions has not been investigated empirically in detail. In this paper, we map society-wide communication networks to the urban areas of two European countries. We show that both the total number of contacts and the total communication activity grow superlinearly with city population size, according to well-defined scaling relations and resulting from a multiplicative increase that affects most citizens. Perhaps surprisingly, however, the probability that an individual's contacts are also connected with each other remains largely unaffected. These empirical results predict a systematic and scale-invariant acceleration of interaction-based spreading phenomena as cities get bigger, which is numerically confirmed by applying epidemiological models to the studied networks. Our findings should provide a microscopic basis towards understanding the superlinear increase of different socioeconomic quantities with city size, that applies to almost all urban systems and includes, for instance, the creation of new inventions or the prevalence of certain contagious diseases.},

	abstract = {By treating the suicide as a social fact, Durkheim envisaged that suicide rates should be determined by the connections between people and society. Under the same framework, he considered that crime is bound up with the fundamental conditions of all social life. The social effect on the occurrence of homicides has been previously substantiated, and confirmed here, in terms of a superlinear scaling relation: by doubling the population of a Brazilian city results in an average increment of 135\% in the number of homicides, rather than the expected isometric increase of 100\%, as found, for example, for the mortality due to car crashes. Here we present statistical signs of the social influence on the suicide occurrence in cities. Differently from homicides (superlinear) and fatal events in car crashes (isometric), we find sublinear scaling behavior between the number of suicides and city population, with allometric power-law exponents, b 5 0.84 6 0.02 and 0.87 6 0.01, for all cities in Brazil and {US} counties, respectively. Also for suicides in {US}, but using the Metropolitan Statistical Areas ({MSAs}), we obtain b 5 0.88 6 0.01. I t is not uncommon in nature to observe properties that present non-trivial forms of scale dependence. This is the case, for instance, of critical phenomena, where scaling invariance, universal properties and renormaliza-tion concepts constitute the theoretical framework of a well-established field in physics 4. In biology, the so-called allometric relations certainly represent outstanding examples of natural scaling laws. Precisely, allometry implies the use of power-laws, Y / M b , to describe the dependence of a wide range of anatomical, physiological and behavioral properties, denoted here as Y, on the size or the body mass of different animal species, M. If the scaling exponent is b 5 1, the variables Y and M are trivially proportional, and the relation between them is said to be isometric, while b ? 1 indicates an allometric type of relationship. The so-called ''three-quarters law'' or Kleiber's law, as originally proposed by the agricultural biologist Max Kleiber in 1947 5 , is surely one of the most prominent allometric relations found in natural sciences. Based on an extensive set of experimental data, this fundamental law states that the metabolic rate of all animals should scale to the 3/4 power of their corresponding masses 6,7. In analogy with biological scaling laws, Bettencourt et al. 2 showed that, regardless the enormous complexity and diversity of human behavior and the extraordinary geographic variability of urban settlements, cities belonging to the same urban system obey pervasive allometric relations with population size, therefore exhibiting nonextensive rates of innovation, wealth creation, patterns of consumption, human social behavior, and several other properties related to the urban infrastructure. The authors then conclude that all data can be grouped into three categories, namely, material infrastructure, individual human needs, and patterns of social activity. Despite the unambiguous presence of power-laws, the urban indicators do not necessarily follow a universal behavior. Instead the results can be divided in three different classes. The isometric (linear) case (b 5 1) typically reflects the scaling of individual human needs, like the number of jobs, houses, and water consumption. As in biology, the allometric sublinear behavior (b , 1) implies an economy of scale in the quantity of interest, because its per capita measurement decreases with population size. In the case of cities, this is materialized, for example, in the number of gasoline stations, the total length of electrical cables, and the road surface (material and infrastructure). The case of superlinear allometry (b. 1) in urban indicators emerges whenever the complex patterns of social activity have significant influence. Wages, income, growth domestic product, bank deposits, as well as rates of invention, measured by new patents and employment in creative sectors, all display a superlinear increase with population size 2. While these results indicate that larger cities are associated with higher levels of human productivity and quality of life, superlinear scaling can also characterize negative urban scenarios, such as the prospect of living costs, crime rates, pollution and disease incidence 2,3,8-10 .},

We evaluate the spread of long-term emotional states across a social network. We introduce a novel form of the classical susceptible-infected-susceptible disease model which includes the possibility for 'spontaneous' (or 'automatic') infection, in addition to disease transmission (the {SISa} model). Using this framework and data from the Framingham Heart Study, we provide formal evidence that positive and negative emotional states behave like infectious diseases spreading across social networks over long periods of time. The probability of becoming content is increased by 0.02 per year for each content contact, and the probability of becoming discontent is increased by 0.04 per year per discontent contact. Our mathematical formalism allows us to derive various quantities from the data, such as the average lifetime of a contentment 'infection' (10 years) or discontentment 'infection' (5 years). Our results give insight into the transmissive nature of positive and negative emotional states. Determining to what extent particular emotions or behaviours are infectious is a promising direction for further research with important implications for social science, epidemiology and health policy. Our model provides a theoretical framework for studying the interpersonal spread of any state that may also arise spontaneously, such as emotions behaviours, health states, ideas or diseases with reservoirs. © 2010 The Royal Society.},

	abstract = {Nodes in networks are often of different types, and in this sense networks are differentiated. Here we examine the relationship between network differentiation and network size in networks under economic or natural selective pressure, such as electronic circuits (networks of electronic components), Lego™ (networks of Lego™ pieces), businesses (networks of employees), universities (networks of faculty), organisms (networks of cells), ant colonies (networks of ants), and nervous systems (networks of neurons). For each of these we find that (i) differentiation increases with network size, and (ii) the relationship is consistent with a power law. These results are explained by a hypothesis that, because nodes are costly to build and maintain in such "selected networks", network size is optimized, and from this the power-law relationship may be derived. The scaling exponent depends on the particular kind of network, and is determined by the degree to which nodes are used in a combinatorial fashion to carry out network-level functions. We find that networks under natural selection (organisms, ant colonies, and nervous systems) have much higher combinatorial abilities than the networks for which human ingenuity is involved (electronic circuits, Legos, businesses, and universities). A distinct but related optimization hypothesis may be used to explain scaling of differentiation in competitive networks (networks where the nodes themselves, rather than the entire network, are under selective pressure) such as ecosystems (networks of organisms). © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

	abstract = {We study how urban quality evolves as a result of carbon dioxide emissions as urban agglomerations grow. We employ a bottom-up approach combining two unprecedented microscopic data on population and carbon dioxide emissions in the continental {US}. We first aggregate settlements that are close to each other into cities using the City Clustering Algorithm ({CCA}) defining cities beyond the administrative boundaries. Then, we use data on {CO}2 emissions at a fine geographic scale to determine the total emissions of each city. We find a superlinear scaling behavior, expressed by a power-law, between {CO}2 emissions and city population with average allometric exponent β = 1.46 across all cities in the {US}. This result suggests that the high productivity of large cities is done at the expense of a proportionally larger amount of emissions compared to small cities. Furthermore, our results are substantially different from those obtained by the standard administrative definition of cities, i.e. Metropolitan Statistical Area ({MSA}). Specifically, {MSAs} display isometric scaling emissions and we argue that this discrepancy is due to the overestimation of {MSA} areas. The results suggest that allometric studies based on administrative boundaries to define cities may suffer from endogeneity bias.},

	abstract = {With urban population increasing dramatically worldwide, cities are playing an increasingly critical role in human societies and the sustainability of the planet. An obstacle to effective policy is the lack of meaningful urban metrics based on a quantitative understanding of cities. Typically, linear per capita indicators are used to characterize and rank cities. However, these implicitly ignore the fundamental role of nonlinear agglomeration integral to the life history of cities. As such, per capita indicators conflate general nonlinear effects, common to all cities, with local dynamics, specific to each city, failing to provide direct measures of the impact of local events and policy. Agglomeration nonlinearities are explicitly manifested by the superlinear power law scaling of most urban socioeconomic indicators with population size, all with similar exponents (*1.15). As a result larger cities are disproportionally the centers of innovation, wealth and crime, all to approximately the same degree. We use these general urban laws to develop new urban metrics that disentangle dynamics at different scales and provide true measures of local urban performance. New rankings of cities and a novel and simpler perspective on urban systems emerge. We find that local urban dynamics display long-term memory, so cities under or outperforming their size expectation maintain such (dis)advantage for decades. Spatiotemporal correlation analyses reveal a novel functional taxonomy of U.S. metropolitan areas that is generally not organized geographically but based instead on common local economic models, innovation strategies and patterns of crime.},

	abstract = {There is persuasive evidence that each of the three main types of skin cancer, basal cell carcinoma ({PCC}), squamous cell carcinoma ({SCC}) and melanoma, is caused by sun exposure. The incidence rate of each is higher in fairer skinned, sun-sensitive rather than darker skinned, less sun-sensitive people; risk increases with increasing ambient solar radiation; the highest densities are on the most sun exposed parts of the body and the lowest on the least exposed; and they are associated in individuals with total (mainly {SCC}), occupational (mainly {SCC}) and non-occupational or recreational sun exposure (mainly melanoma and {BCC}) and a history of sunburn and presence of benign sun damage in the skin. That {UV} radiation specifically causes these skin cancers depends on indirect inferences from the action spectrum of solar radiation for skin cancer from studies in animals and the action spectrum for dipyrimidine dimers and evidence that presumed causative mutations for skin cancer arise most commonly at dipyrimidine sites. Sun protection is essential if skin cancer incidence is to be reduced. The epidemiological data suggest that in implementing sun protection an increase in intermittency of exposure should be avoided, that sun protection will have the greatest impact if achieved as early as possible in life and that it will probably have an impact later in life, especially in those who had high childhood exposure to solar radiation. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Overall, cancer poses the highest clinical, social, and economic burden in terms of cause-specific Disability-Adjusted Life Years ({DALYs}) among all human diseases. The overall 0-74 years risk of developing cancer is 20.2\% (22.4\% in men and 18.2\% in women, respectively). A total number of 18 million new cases have been diagnosed in 2018, the most frequent of which are lung (2.09 million cases), breast (2.09 million cases), and prostate (1.28 million cases) cancers. Beside sex-specific malignancies, the ratio of frequency between men and women is {\textgreater}1 for all cancers, except thyroid (i.e., 0.30). As concerns mortality, cancer is the second worldwide cause of death (8.97 million deaths) after ischemic heart disease, but will likely become the first in 2060 (∼18.63 million deaths). Lung, liver, and stomach are the three most deadly cancers in the general population, while lung and breast cancers are the leading causes of cancer related-mortality in men and women, respectively. Prostate and thyroid cancers have the best prognosis, with 5-year survival ∼100\%, while esophagus, liver, and especially pancreas cancers have the worst prognosis, typically {\textless}20\% at 5 years.

We track billions of anonymized {GPS} human mobility datapoints to monitor the evolution of the contact network of disease transmission before and after mass quarantines. As a consequence of the lockdowns, people's mobility decreases by 53\%, which results in a drastic disintegration of the transmission network by 90\%. However, this disintegration did not halt the spreading of the disease. Our analysis indicates that superspreading k-core structures persist in the transmission network to prolong the pandemic.

We collected extensive individual case reports across China and estimated key epidemiologic parameters, including the incubation period (4.2 days). We then designed 2 mathematical modeling approaches to infer the outbreak dynamics in Wuhan by using high-resolution domestic travel and infection data. Results show that the doubling time early in the epidemic in Wuhan was 2.3–3.3 days. Assuming a serial interval of 6–9 days, we calculated a median R0 value of 5.7 (95\% {CI} 3.8–8.9).

When the information refers to a particular node at which both quantities are measured, the model can be taken as a model for gossip propagation. In this context, we apply the model to real empirical networks of social acquaintances and compare the underlying spreading dynamics with different types of scale-free and small-world networks. We find that the number of friendship connections strongly influences the probability of being gossiped.

Identifying the most efficient 'spread-ers' in a network is an important step towards optimizing the use of available resources and ensuring the more efficient spread of information. Here we show that, in contrast to common belief, there are plausible circumstances where the best spreaders do not correspond to the most highly connected or the most central people 6-10 . Instead, we find that the most efficient spreaders are those located within the core of the network as identified by the k-shell decomposition analysis 11-13 , and that when multiple spreaders are considered simultaneously the distance between them becomes the crucial parameter that determines the extent of the spreading. Furthermore, we show that infections persist in the high-k shells of the network in the case where recovered individuals do not develop immunity. Our analysis should provide a route for an optimal design of efficient dissemination strategies. © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.},

The measures are closely related to, and cast new light on, widely used measures of actors' centrality; for example, the essential social organization of status that has been assumed by Hubbell, Bonacich, Coleman, and Burt appears as a deducible outcome of this social influence process. Unlike previous measures, which have been viewed as competing alternatives, the present measures are complementary and, in their juxtaposition, provide for a rich description of social structure. The complementary indicates a degree of theoretical unification in the work on network centrality that was heretofore unsuspected.},

	abstract = {Why are certain pieces of online content (e.g., advertisements, videos, news articles) more viral than others? This article takes a psychological approach to understanding diffusion. Using a unique data set of all the New York Times articles published over a three-month period, the authors examine how emotion shapes virality. The results indicate that positive content is more viral than negative content, but the relationship between emotion and social transmission is more complex than valence alone. Virality is partially driven by physiological arousal. Content that evokes high-arousal positive (awe) or negative (anger or anxiety) emotions is more viral. Content that evokes low-arousal, or deactivating, emotions (e.g., sadness) is less viral. These results hold even when the authors control for how surprising, interesting, or practically useful content is (all of which are positively linked to virality), as well as external drivers of attention (e.g., how prominently content was featured). Experimental results further demonstrate the causal impact of specific emotion on transmission and illustrate that it is driven by the level of activation induced. Taken together, these findings shed light on why people share content and how to design more effective viral marketing campaigns.},

	abstract = {We report temporal patterns of viral shedding in 94 patients with laboratory-confirmed {COVID}-19 and modeled {COVID}-19 infectiousness profiles from a separate sample of 77 infec-tor-infectee transmission pairs. We observed the highest viral load in throat swabs at the time of symptom onset, and inferred that infectiousness peaked on or before symptom onset. We estimated that 44\% (95\% confidence interval, 30-57\%) of secondary cases were infected during the index cases' presymptomatic stage, in settings with substantial household clustering, active case finding and quarantine outside the home. Disease control measures should be adjusted to account for probable substantial presymptomatic transmission. {SARS}-{CoV}-2, the causative agent of {COVID}-19, spreads efficiently , with a basic reproductive number of 2.2 to 2.5 determined in Wuhan 1,2. The effectiveness of control measures depends on several key epidemiological parameters (Fig. 1a), including the serial interval (duration between symptom onsets of successive cases in a transmission chain) and the incubation period (time between infection and onset of symptoms). Variation between individuals and transmission chains is summarized by the incubation period distribution and the serial interval distribution, respectively. If the observed mean serial interval is shorter than the observed mean incubation period, this indicates that a significant portion of transmission may have occurred before infected persons have developed symptoms. Significant presymptomatic transmission would probably reduce the effectiveness of control measures that are initiated by symptom onset, such as isolation, contact tracing and enhanced hygiene or use of face masks for symptomatic persons. {SARS} (severe acute respiratory syndrome) was notable, because infectiousness increased around 7-10 days after symptom onset 3,4. Onward transmission can be substantially reduced by containment measures such as isolation and quarantine (Fig. 1a) 5. In contrast , influenza is characterized by increased infectiousness shortly around or even before symptom onset 6. In this study, we compared clinical data on virus shedding with separate epidemiologic data on incubation periods and serial intervals between cases in transmission chains, to draw inferences on infectiousness profiles. Among 94 patients with laboratory-confirmed {COVID}-19 admitted to Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital, 47/94 (50\%) were male, the median age was 47 years and 61/93 (66\%) were moderately ill (with fever and/or respiratory symptoms and radiographic evidence of pneumonia), but none were classified as 'severe' or 'critical' on hospital admission (Supplementary Table 1). A total of 414 throat swabs were collected from these 94 patients, from symptom onset up to 32 days after onset. We detected high viral loads soon after symptom onset, which then gradually decreased towards the detection limit at about day 21. There was no obvious difference in viral loads across sex, age groups and disease severity (Fig. 2). Separately, based on 77 transmission pairs obtained from publicly available sources within and outside mainland China (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Table 2), the serial interval was estimated to have a mean of 5.8 days (95\% confidence interval ({CI}), 4.8-6.8 days) and a median of 5.2 days (95\% {CI}, 4.1-6.4 days) based on a fitted gamma distribution, with 7.6\% negative serial intervals (Fig. 1c). Assuming an incubation period distribution of mean 5.2 days from a separate study of early {COVID}-19 cases 1 , we inferred that infectiousness started from 12.3 days (95\% {CI}, 5.9-17.0 days) before symptom onset and peaked at symptom onset (95\% {CI},-0.9-0.9 days) (Fig. 1c). We further observed that only {\textless}0.1\% of transmission would occur before 7 days, 1\% of transmission would occur before 5 days and 9\% of transmission would occur before 3 days prior to symptom onset. The estimated proportion of presymptomatic transmission (area under the curve) was 44\% (95\% {CI}, 30-57\%). Infectiousness was estimated to decline quickly within 7 days. Viral load data were not used in the estimation but showed a similar monotonic decreasing pattern. In sensitivity analysis, using the same estimating procedure but holding constant the start of infectiousness from 5, 8 and 11 days before symptom onset, infectiousness was shown to peak at 2 days before to 1 day after symptom onset, and the proportion of pres-ymptomatic transmission ranged from 37\% to 48\% (Extended Data Fig. 1). Finally, simulation showed that the proportion of short serial intervals (for example, {\textless}2 days) would be larger if infectiousness were assumed to start before symptom onset (Extended Data Fig. 2). Given the 7.6\% negative serial intervals estimated from the infec-tor-infectee paired data, start of infectiousness at least 2 days before onset and peak infectiousness at 2 days before to 1 day after onset would be most consistent with this observed proportion (Extended Data Fig. 3). Here, we used detailed information on the timing of symptom onsets in transmission pairs to infer the infectiousness profile of},

However, how this distribution arises has not been conclusively demonstrated in direct analyses of people's actions in social networks. Here, we perform a causal inference analysis and find an underlying cause for this phenomenon. Our analysis indicates that heavy-tailed degree distribution is causally determined by similarly skewed distribution of human activity. Specifically, the degree of an individual is entirely random - following a "maximum entropy attachment" model - except for its mean value which depends deterministically on the volume of the users' activity. This relation cannot be explained by interactive models, like preferential attachment, since the observed actions are not likely to be caused by interactions with other people.},

Our results show that the effective reproduction numbers inside the buses, \$\$Re{\textasciicircum}\{bus\}\$\$, and in the city, \$\$Re{\textasciicircum}\{city\}\$\$, followed a compatible behavior during the first wave of the local outbreak. Moreover, by distinguishing the close contacts of healthcare workers in the buses, we discovered that their transmission, \$\$Re{\textasciicircum}\{health\}\$\$, during the same period, was systematically higher than \$\$Re{\textasciicircum}\{bus\}\$\$.

However, difficulties associated with inference from time-series data about unknown parameters in these models have been a constraint on their application. We present a new method that makes maximum likelihood estimation feasible for partially-observed nonlinear stochastic dynamical systems (also known as state-space models) where this was not previously the case. The method is based on a sequence of filtering operations which are shown to converge to a maximum likelihood parameter estimate. We make use of recent advances in nonlinear filtering in the implementation of the algorithm. We apply the method to the study of cholera in Bangladesh. We construct confidence intervals, perform residual analysis, and apply other diagnostics.

We develop a self-tuning particle filter in which the proposal distribution is constructed adaptively through a sequence of Monte Carlo steps. Intuitively, we start from a measurement error distribution with an inflated variance, and then gradually reduce the variance to its nominal level in a sequence of tempering steps. We show that the filter generates an unbiased and consistent approximation of the likelihood function.

	abstract = {Since the emergence of the first cases in Wuhan, China, the novel coronavirus (2019-{nCoV}) infection has been quickly spreading out to other provinces and neighboring countries. Estimation of the basic reproduction number by means of mathematical modeling can be helpful for determining the potential and severity of an outbreak and providing critical information for identifying the type of disease interventions and intensity. A deterministic compartmental model was devised based on the clinical progression of the disease, epidemiological status of the individuals, and intervention measures. The estimations based on likelihood and model analysis show that the control reproduction number may be as high as 6.47 (95\% {CI} 5.71–7.23). Sensitivity analyses show that interventions, such as intensive contact tracing followed by quarantine and isolation, can effectively reduce the control reproduction number and transmission risk, with the effect of travel restriction adopted by Wuhan on 2019-{nCoV} infection in Beijing being almost equivalent to increasing quarantine by a 100 thousand baseline value. It is essential to assess how the expensive, resource-intensive measures implemented by the Chinese authorities can contribute to the prevention and control of the 2019-{nCoV} infection, and how long they should be maintained. Under the most restrictive measures, the outbreak is expected to peak within two weeks (since 23 January 2020) with a significant low peak value. With travel restriction (no imported exposed individuals to Beijing), the number of infected individuals in seven days will decrease by 91.14\% in Beijing, compared with the scenario of no travel restriction.},

Mostro que se trata de um processo inconcluso, que ocorre pela pressão de atores e pela força dos acontecimentos. Inicialmente o tema se inclui de forma reduzida, por meio dos conceitos de "acidentes, lesões e traumas". Já a partir da segunda metade do século 20, há a incorporação da pauta de direitos de vários sujeitos sociais, que vai desde a entrada da observação e notificação da violência contra crianças, mulheres e idosos, até a discussão da violência social, no seu sentido mais amplo, afetando a saúde das populações. No Brasil, esse processo, sem dúvida lento e intermitente, tem alguns logros e pioneirismos encenados pelo Ministério da Saúde, com a colaboração e a pressão de movimentos sociais, acadêmicos e profissionais: um documento de diagnóstico da situação de morbimortalidade por todos os tipos de violência; documento de uma Política Nacional de Redução de Acidentes e Violências e um Plano de Ação Nacional.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Regression analysis supports an economic inequality interpretation of violence. Latinos' socioeconomic conditions were consistently linked to homicide, but sociodemographics also influenced murder. The conclusions stress the need for addressing the link between socioeconomic conditions and urban Latino homicide, paying special attention to educational attainment and economic inequality within the Latino population.},

Because spikes are (relatively) sparse, patterns of activity with increasing numbers of spikes are less probable, but, with more spikes, the number of possible patterns increases. This tradeoff between probability and numerosity is mathematically equivalent to the relationship between entropy and energy in statistical physics. We construct this relationship for populations of up to N = 160 neurons in a small patch of the vertebrate retina, using a combination of direct and model-based analyses of experiments on the response of this network to naturalistic movies.We see signs of a thermodynamic limit, where the entropy per neuron approaches a smooth function of the energy per neuron as N increases. The form of this function corresponds to the distribution of activity being poised near an unusual kind of critical point. We suggest further tests of criticality, and give a brief discussion of its functional significance.},

Here we consider inhomogeneous systems in which we constrain, for example, not the full matrix of correlations, but only the distribution from which these correlations are drawn. In this sense, what we have constructed is an inverse spin glass: rather than choosing coupling constants at random from a distribution and calculating correlations, we choose the correlations from a distribution and infer the coupling constants. We argue that such models generate a block structure in the space of couplings, which provides an explicit solution of the inverse problem. This allows us to generate a phase diagram in the space of (measurable) moments of the distribution of correlations. We expect that these ideas will be most useful in building models for systems that are nonequilibrium statistical mechanics problems, such as networks of real neurons.},

It is not just that thousands of individuals fly, on average, in the same direction and at the same speed, but that even the fluctuations around the mean velocity are correlated over long distances. Quantitative measurements on flocks of starlings, in particular, show that these fluctuations are scale-free, with effective correlation lengths proportional to the linear size of the flock. Here we construct models for the joint distribution of velocities in the flock that reproduce the observed local correlations between individuals and their neighbors, as well as the variance of flight speeds across individuals, but otherwise have as little structure as possible. These minimally structured or maximum entropy models provide quantitative, parameter-free predictions for the spread of correlations throughout the flock, and these are in excellent agreement with the data. These models are mathematically equivalent to statistical physics models for ordering in magnets, and the correct prediction of scale-free correlations arises because the parameters- completely determined by the data-are in the critical regime. In biological terms, criticality allows the flock to achieve maximal correlation across long distances with limited speed fluctuations.},

The numerical results show that the effective-medium approximation predicts the right scaling behavior of the permeability and of the velocity fluctuations, in terms of the aperture of the fracture, the roughness exponent, and the characteristic length of the fracture surfaces, in the limit of small separation between surfaces. The permeability of the fractures is also investigated as a function of the normal and lateral relative displacements between surfaces, and it is shown that it can be bounded by the permeability of two-dimensional fractures. The development of channel-like structures in the velocity field is also numerically investigated for different relative displacements between surfaces. Finally, the dispersion of tracer particles in the velocity field of the fractures is investigated by analytic and numerical methods. The asymptotic dominant role of the geometric dispersion, due to velocity fluctuations and their spatial correlations, is shown in the limit of very small separation between fracture surfaces. © 2002 The American Physical Society.},

We then construct network ensembles that generalize the network instances observed in the experiment, and study their thermodynamic behavior and coding capacity. Based on this construction, we can also create synthetic networks of 120 neurons, and find that with increasing size the networks operate closer to a critical point and start exhibiting collective behaviors reminiscent of spin glasses.

	abstract = {‘Scale-free’ networks, such as linked web pages, people in social groups, or cellular interaction networks show uneven connectivity distributions: there is no typical number of links per node. Many of these networks also exhibit the ‘small-world’ effect, called ‘six degrees of separation’ when applied to sociology. A new analysis of such networks, in which nodes are partitioned into boxes of different sizes, reveals that they share the surprising feature of self-similarity. In other words, these networks are constructed of fractal-like self-repeating patterns or degrees of separation. This may help explain how the scale-free property of such networks arises. Complex networks have been studied extensively owing to their relevance to many real systems such as the world-wide web, the Internet, energy landscapes and biological and social networks1,2,3,4,5. A large number of real networks are referred to as ‘scale-free’ because they show a power-law distribution of the number of links per node1,6,7. However, it is widely believed that complex networks are not invariant or self-similar under a length-scale transformation. This conclusion originates from the ‘small-world’ property of these networks, which implies that the number of nodes increases exponentially with the ‘diameter’ of the network8,9,10,11, rather than the power-law relation expected for a self-similar structure. Here we analyse a variety of real complex networks and find that, on the contrary, they consist of self-repeating patterns on all length scales. This result is achieved by the application of a renormalization procedure that coarse-grains the system into boxes containing nodes within a given ‘size’. We identify a power-law relation between the number of boxes needed to cover the network and the size of the box, defining a finite self-similar exponent. These fundamental properties help to explain the scale-free nature of complex networks and suggest a common self-organization dynamics.},

	url = {www.nature.com/scientificreports/},
	doi = {10.1038/srep27987},
	abstract = {Random lasers have been recently exploited as a photonic platform for studies of complex systems. This cross-disciplinary approach opened up new important avenues for the understanding of random-laser behavior, including Lévy-type distributions of strong intensity fluctuations and phase transitions to a photonic spin-glass phase. In this work, we employ the Nd:{YBO} random laser system to unveil, from a single set of measurements, the physical origin of the complex correspondence between the Lévy fluctuation regime and the replica-symmetry-breaking transition to the spin-glass phase. A novel unexpected finding is also reported: the trend to suppress the spin-glass behavior for high excitation pulse energies. The present description from first principles of this correspondence unfolds new possibilities to characterize other random lasers, such as random fiber lasers, nanolasers and small lasers, which include plasmonic-based, photonic-crystal and bio-derived nanodevices. The statistical nature of the emission provided by random lasers can also impact on their prominent use as sources for speckle-free laser imaging, which nowadays represents one of the most promising applications of random lasers, with expected progress even in cancer research. Random lasers 1-3 ({RLs}) are a special class of lasers with Lévy-type distributions of intensity fluctuations 4-13 , which has been recently exploited as a photonic platform for studies of complex systems, such as spin glasses 14-22. {RLs} were originally proposed 23 by Letokhov in the late 1960's, but their first unambiguous observation was only reported in 1994 by Lawandy and collaborators 24. Over the last two decades, studies in {RLs} have grown fantastically , including investigations on a myriad of interdisciplinary systems, from cold-atoms {RLs} 25 and biomaterials 26 to speckle-free laser imaging 27 and cancer diagnostic 28,29. In a {RL} system the gain medium, which can be independent of the scatterer or simultaneously gain and scat-terer, provides the optical amplification. If the gain medium is independent, the scattering nanoparticles with random spatial distribution are responsible for the necessary optical feedback 1-3. The external cavity typical of conventional lasers is therefore not required. {RL} emission has been analyzed in terms of the optical modes and has been regarded as highly multimode 30 , in which the spectral signature can indicate that such modes are averaged out leading to a smooth spectrum, or can indicate the presence of several modes through narrowband spikes appearing after the threshold is reached 31. In this work, we demonstrate both theoretically and experimentally the correspondence between the spin-glass behavior of {RLs} and the Lévy flight statistics of intensity fluctuations. In the photonic context, the term spin glass ({SG}) means that intensity spectra emitted under identical experimental conditions keep a complex pattern of correlations 15-22 , as quantified below. Moreover, the Lévy statistics implies strong fluctuations in the emission intensity, with non-Gaussian heavy-tailed distribution 4-13 .},

	abstract = {Recent work has shown that probabilistic models based on pairwise interactions-in the simplest case, the Ising model-provide surprisingly accurate descriptions of experiments on real biological networks ranging from neurons to genes. Finding these models requires us to solve an inverse problem: given experimentally measured expectation values, what are the parameters of the underlying Hamiltonian? This problem sits at the intersection of statistical physics and machine learning, and we suggest that more efficient solutions are possible by merging ideas from the two fields. We use a combination of recent coordinate descent algorithms with an adaptation of the histogram Monte Carlo method, and implement these techniques to take advantage of the sparseness found in data on real neurons.

	issn = {23318422},
	abstract = {The observation of time evolution of Representative’s votes for several bills, without any knowledge of the bill’s contents, and without any hypothetical question asked to the Representatives, is a way to perform a no questionnaire, using only revealed choices, sociology study. Transparency laws requiring Representative votes to be publicly available assure that no privacy right was violated in this kind of study. The votes data can be used to obtain Representative versus Representative correlation, and correlation distance matrices, from which one can extract Minimum Spanning Tree ({MST}) networks. {MST} ordered correlation matrices display clearly the Representative clusters and the political diversity in that society, while the time evolution of the correlation coefficient distribution can show the degree of polarization of the parliament, and typical trajectories during a presidential term. Atypical polarization trajectory, observed in both, {MST} correlation matrices and correlation distribution, is a sign of political instability and can provide an indicator of the imminence of a fall of the Government. The general problem addressed by this paper is how to use the Representative votes only to extract Representative’s {MST} networks, correlation distribution and clusters, polarization degree and signs of political instability. Here we show, that a typical presidential term trajectory evolves from a big Government supporters cluster, surrounded by the opposition in a strongly polarised state in the first year, to a consensus at the end, and that political instability arise when a small hard cluster of Government supporters is opposed by several, even dispersed, clusters. The first difference of our study in comparison to previous studies was the use of a scale of seven vote possibilities, instead of the typical yea or nay scale used in other studies, because it is clear that the option to not vote, or others, is also a political expression and shall be used in the correlation between Representatives. Also, the use of correlation distance {MST} ordered matrices, as far as we know, for the first time, revealed clearly the blind clusters regardless the Representative party, state or any other attribute. Finally, the time evolution results for more than two presidential terms revealed a typical trajectory and the situation of high political instability in the unique rare event of a presidential impeachment we could observe. The methodology used here is unbiased, because there was no question, impossible to be formulated without bias, asked to Representatives, and, also, uses only revealed choices instead of a quick Representative answer to hypothetical question that can be much different from the answer in the real situation. No questionnaire sociology could be used nowadays observing spontaneous speeches of internet users in Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, {LinkedIn} and other social networks, provided that no privacy right is broken, when it is possible to infer that the sample used is representative of the whole society. Correlation distances can be obtained for any set of elements that share some attributes, and {MST} can be drawn out of these distances, opening up the way to increase the degree of generalization of our procedure beyond the specific question it was used for. That means this methodology could be applied to sociology, economics, biology, genetics, diseases, drug responses and other knowledge fields.},

Precisely, our results show that the arbitrary geopolitical definition based on the Metropolitan/Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Areas ({MSA}/{CMSA}) leads to a sublinear power-law growth of {NTL} with {POP}. On the other hand, when cities are defined according to a more natural agglomeration criteria, namely, the City Clustering Algorithm ({CCA}), an isometric relation emerges between {NTL} and population. This discrepancy is compatible with results from previous works showing that the scaling behaviors of various urban indicators with population can be substantially different for distinct definitions of city boundaries. Moreover, considering the {CCA} definition as more adequate than the {MSA}/{CMSA} one because the former does not violate the expected extensivity between land population and area of their generated clusters, we conclude that, without loss of generality, the {CCA} measures of light pollution and population could be interchangeably utilized in future studies.},

As a specific example we consider recent experimental results on the fatigue fracture of asphalt. Our numerical simulations show that for intermediate applied loads the lifetime of the specimen presents a power law behavior. Under the effect of healing, more prominent for small loads compared to the tensile strength of the material, the lifetime of the sample increases and a fatigue limit emerges below which no macroscopic failure occurs.

Here we apply the optimal path crack model ({OPC}) to investigate the mobility of road networks and propose a new proxy for resilience of urban mobility. In contrast to static approaches, the {OPC} accounts for the dynamics of rerouting as a response to traffic jams. Precisely, one simulates a sequence of failures (cracks) at the most vulnerable segments of the optimal origin-destination paths that are capable to collapse the system. Our results with synthetic and real road networks reveal that their levels of disorder, fractions of unidirectional segments and spatial correlations can drastically affect the vulnerability to traffic congestion. By applying the {OPC} to downtown Boston and Manhattan, we found that Boston is significantly more vulnerable than Manhattan. This is compatible with the fact that Boston heads the list of American metropolitan areas with the highest average time waste in traffic. Moreover, our analysis discloses that the origin of this difference comes from the intrinsic spatial correlations of each road network. Finally, we argue that, due to their global influence, the most important cracks identified with {OPC} can be used to pinpoint potential small rerouting and structural changes in road networks that are capable to substantially improve urban mobility.},

Some physical models, like the Progressive Leader Model, also do not consider variations in the properties of the air. The Electric Field Deflection ({EFD}) was recently proposed in literature. This model is sensitive to small variations in the permittivity of the air. To simulate these air variations, a two-dimensional landscape of the electric permittivity was created using fractional Brownian motion ({fBm}). This technique was combined with {EFD} to simulate the trajectories of lightning discharges through the Finite Element Method ({FEM}). This proposed method, called {EFD}-{fBm}, was used to analyze the air-termination system of a power transmission line and compared to the Electrogeometric Model. Discharges with current peaks of 2.9, 5.4, 10.1 and 15.7 {kA} were studied according to the lightning protection standards. The transmission line was analyzed in two transverse planes: a plane with the tower and another one comprising the span between two towers. Landscapes constructed through {fBm} were used. The proposed model estimated that the efficiency of the air-termination system of the transmission line analyzed was 96.36\% for discharges with current peak of 10.1 {kA}.},

We used correlation and correlation distance matrices of Brazilian Representative votes during four presidential terms. Re-ordering these matrices with Minimal Spanning Trees displays the dynamical formation of clusters for the sixteen year period, which includes one Presidential impeachment. The reordered matrices, colored by correlation strength and by the parties clearly show the origin of observed clusters and their evolution over time. When large clusters provide government support cluster breaks, political instability arises, which could lead to an impeachment, a trend we observed three years before the Brazilian President was impeached.

The scaling analysis demonstrates that the exponent of the power law distributed fragment mass does not depend on the impact velocity; the apparent change of the exponent predicted by recent simulations can be attributed to the shifting cutoff and to the existence of unbreakable discrete units. Our calculations reveal that the characteristic time scale of the breakup process has a power law dependence on the impact speed and on the distance from the critical speed in the damaged and fragmented states, respectively.

The results prove to be independent of the degree of disorder in the model, but mean fragment sizes scale with velocity. Our results reproduce many experimental observations of fragment shapes, impact energy dependence or mass distribution, and significantly improve the understanding of the fragmentation process for impact fracture since we have full access to the failure conditions and evolution. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2008.},

	abstract = {In this standard reference of the field, theoretical and experimental approaches to flow, hydrodynamic dispersion, and miscible displacements in porous media and fractured rock are considered. Two different approaches are discussed and contrasted with each other. The first approach is based on the classical equations of flow and transport, called 'continuum models'. The second approach is based on modern methods of statistical physics of disordered media; that is, on 'discrete models', which have become increasingly popular over the past 15 years. The book is unique in its scope, since (1) there is currently no book that compares the two approaches, and covers all important aspects of porous media problems; and (2) includes discussion of fractured rocks, which so far has been treated as a separate subject. Portions of the book would be suitable for an advanced undergraduate course. The book will be ideal for graduate courses on the subject, and can be used by chemical, petroleum, civil, environmental engineers, and geologists, as well as physicists, applied physicist and allied scientists that deal with various porous media problems. © 2011 Wiley-{VCH} Verlag {GmbH} \& Co. {KGaA}.},

The drag force on the spheres, and hence the permeability of the arrays, is determined at small but finite Reynolds numbers, at solid volume fractions up to the close-packed limits of the arrays. For small solid volume fraction, the simulations are compared to theory, showing that the first inertial contribution to the drag force, when scaled with the Stokes drag force on a single sphere in an unbounded fluid, is proportional to the square of the Reynolds number. The simulations show that this scaling persists at solid volume fractions up to the close-packed limits of the arrays, and that the first inertial contribution to the drag force relative to the Stokes-flow drag force decreases with increasing solid volume fraction. The temporal evolution of the spatially averaged velocity and the drag force is examined when the fluid is accelerated from rest by a constant average pressure gradient toward a steady Stokes flow. Theory for the short- and long-time behaviour is in good agreement with simulations, showing that the unsteady force is dominated by quasi-steady drag and added-mass forces. The short- and long-time added-mass coefficients are obtained from potential-flow and quasi-steady viscous-flow approximations, respectively.},

The cubic law is used to calculate flow behaviors in fractures where flow is laminar, while the Forchheimer's law is used to quantify turbulent flow behaviors. A critical fracture length is used to distinguish flow characteristics in individual fractures. While flows in some fractures may be turbulent, we assume that the fractal fracture network can still be treated as a porous medium where Darcy's law applies and our objective is to determine an effective permeability for the network. The developed new solutions can also be used for the case of a general scaling relationship, an extension to the linear scaling. We examine the impact of fractal fracture network characteristics on the effective permeability of the network. These characteristics include: fractal scaling coefficient and exponent, fractal dimension, ratio of minimum over maximum fracture lengths. The influence of imposed hydraulic gradient and critical length on the effective permeability is also examined and discussed. Results demonstrated that the developed solution can explain more variations of the effective permeability in relation to the fractal dimensions estimated from field observations. At high hydraulic gradient the effective permeability decreases with the fractal scaling exponent, but increases with the fractal scaling exponent at low gradient. The effective permeability increases with the scaling coefficient, fractal dimension, fracture length ratio and maximum fracture length.},

Eng. 1, 325-362. (doi:10.1680/ipeds.1952. 11362)), despite little empirical support. Fine-grained location traces collected by smart devices give us today an unprecedented opportunity to learn how citizens organize their travel plans into a set of routes, and how similar behaviour patterns emerge among distinct individual choices. Herewe study 92 419 anonymized {GPS} trajectories describing the movement of personal cars over an 18-month period. We group user trips by origin-destination and we find that most drivers use a small number of routes for their routine journeys, and tend to have a preferred route for frequent trips. In contrast to the cost minimization assumption, we also find that a significant fraction of drivers' routes are not optimal. We present a spatial probability distribution that bounds the route selection space within an ellipse, having the origin and the destination as focal points, characterized by high eccentricity independent of the scale. While individual routing choices are not captured by path optimization, their spatial bounds are similar, even for trips performed by distinct individuals and at various scales. These basic discoveries can inform realistic route-choice models that are not based on optimization, having an impact on several applications, such as infrastructure planning, routing recommendation systems and new mobility solutions.},

	abstract = {Water injection is a valuable method for produced water disposal and for reservoir pressure support. A disadvantage of water injection operations is the injectivity loss which can occur due to rock and fluid characteristics, formation damage caused by fines migration and by oil and solid particles present in the water. Optimal injection rates can't be achieved when injectivity loss occur. Nevertheless, the injectivity loss can be mitigated by water injection with fracture propagation pressure ({IFPP}) which aims to restore injection capacity. To study this process, a geo-mechanical simulator for fracture modeling combined with a commercial reservoir simulation package is used to model and to optimize the operational conditions of water-injector wells. The fracture is represented by a virtual horizontal well and analytical formulations for hyperbolic decline of permeability represent the effect of formation damage around the injector well. This paper aims to study some water injection cases to verify in which situations the {IFPP} use is convenient. The simulation model studied is a synthetic reservoir with a five-spot pattern. Three scenarios are considered with oil type variation (41, 31 and 21 {API} degrees). Those scenarios are proposed to reproduce some possible situations that can happen in real field, where formation fracturing pressure can be reached by the effect of the injectivity loss or due to rock and fluid characteristics. The {IFPP} acting is evaluated using the net present value ({NPV}) and cumulative oil and water productions. The results showed that the {IFPP} study becomes into an optimization problem of injection rate, where the fracture can or cannot occur. It is shown that {IFPP}, in general, anticipates oil production for cases of intermediate and high oil viscosity, turning a quite advantageous method. Studies in light oil indicate that the technique is only interesting when there is significant injectivity loss, which the {IFPP} aids in injectivity restoration. It is shown that {IFPP} can be advantageous, not only in cases where injectivity loss occurs, but also in cases without injectivity loss, in order to anticipate the oil production.

	abstract = {The development of innovative techniques and concepts, and the emergence of new plays in carbonate rocks are creating a resurgence of oil and gas discoveries worldwide. The maturity of a basin and the application of exploration concepts have a fundamental influence on exploration strategies. Exploration success often occurs in underexplored basins by applying existing established geological concepts. This approach is commonly undertaken when new basins 'open up' owing to previous political upheavals. The strategy of using new techniques in a proven mature area is particularly appropriate when dealing with unconventional resources (heavy oil, bitumen, stranded gas), while the application of new play concepts (such as lacustrine carbonates)to new areas (i.e. ultra-deep South Atlantic basins) epitomizes frontier exploration. Many low-matrix-porosity hydrocarbon reservoirs are productive because permeability is controlled by fractures and faults. Understanding basic fracture properties is critical in reducing geological risk and therefore reducing well costs and increasing well recovery. The advent of resource plays in carbonate rocks, and the long-standing recognition of naturally fractured carbonate reservoirs means that new fracture and fault analysis and prediction techniques and concepts are essential. Akey area of progress has been integration of stratigraphic, structural, geomechanical and diagenetic analysis to populate reservoir models accurately. Dramatic increases in computing and digital imaging capabilities are being harnessed to improve spatial analysis and spatial statistics in reservoirs and ultimately improve 3D geocellular models. © The Geological Society of London 2012.},

The model consists of two parallel flat plates on which two rough, self-affine surfaces, characterized by a roughness exponent H, are superimposed. The methods that we use for computing the effective flow and transport properties of the fracture include the lattice Boltzmann method for computing the flow properties, a random walk method for determining the effective conductivity of the (fluid-saturated) fracture, and the Reynolds approximation. We also develop an asymptotic expression for the effective conductivity. The aperture of the fracture, as well as the roughness of its rough surface, are systematically varied in order to assess their effect on the effective permeability and conductivity of the fracture, and also test the accuracy and consistency of the methods. For large mean apertures, and all values of the roughness exponent H, all the methods yield essentially the same results. However, as the mean aperture decreases, the differences between the predictions of the methods increase significantly. We find that the Reynolds approximation provides relatively accurate estimates of the (hydraulic or electrical) apertures only if the fracture is at least moderately wide and that, similar to real three-dimensional fractures, the electrical aperture is always smaller than the hydraulic fracture.},

	abstract = {The hydro-mechanical response of fractured rock masses is complex, due partly to the presence of fractures at different scales. Surface morphology has a significant influence on fluid flow behaviour of a fracture. Different empirical correlations and statistical models have been proposed to estimate the equivalent hydraulic aperture and determine the pressure drop along a fracture. However, the existing models suffer from not being adequately generalised to be applicable to a wide range of real fracture surfaces. To incorporate the effect of profile roughness in the hydro-mechanical behaviour of fractured rock masses, the joint roughness coefficient ({JRC}) is the most widely used empirical approach. However, the average {JRC} of two fracture walls in fluid flow analysis, as is a common practice, appears to be inappropriate. It will be shown how different combinations of pairs of {JRCs} could lead to a similar {JRC} value. Also, changing the position of the top and bottom walls of a fracture can significantly change the hydraulic response of the fracture while the average {JRC} is identical in both cases. In this paper, correlations are developed which are based on the simulation of {JRCs} using estimated fluid flow parameters of 2D fractures can be estimated. In order to widen the application range of the correlations, {JRC} flow channels were generated: these are 2D channels with their top and bottom walls being made from two of the {JRC} profiles. To estimate the {JRC} of linear profiles, a correlation developed between {JRC} and a newly developed Riemannian roughness parameter, D R1, is proposed. Considering ten {JRC} profiles, a total of 100 {JRC} flow channels were generated. In order to only investigate the effect of surface roughness on fluid flow, the minimum closure between the top and bottom walls of {JRC} flow channels were considered to be constant. Three cases with minimum closures of 0.01, 0.05 and 0.10 cm were considered in this study. All {JRC} flow channels were subjected to fluid analysis using {FLUENT} software. Based on these results, correlations were developed between the geometrical and hydraulic properties of flow channels. Analysis of several real fractures demonstrated the applicability of these correlations. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

The states are localized or extended, homogeneous or oscillating. Combined states are observed as well, like the coexistence of moving localized clusters and clusters pinned at road inhomogeneities, or regions of oscillating congested traffic upstream of nearly homogeneous congested traffic. The experimental findings are consistent with a recently proposed theoretical phase diagram for traffic near on-ramps [D. Helbing, A. Hennecke, and M. Treiber, Phys. Rev. Lett. 82, 4360 (1999)]. We simulate these situations with a continuous microscopic single-lane model, the “intelligent driver model,” using empirical boundary conditions. All observations, including the coexistence of states, are qualitatively reproduced by describing inhomogeneities with local variations of one model parameter. We show that the results of the microscopic model can be understood by formulating the theoretical phase diagram for bottlenecks in a more general way. In particular, a local drop of the road capacity induced by parameter variations has essentially the same effect as an on-ramp. © 2000 The American Physical Society.},

	abstract = {Complex systems are very often organized under the form of networks where nodes and edges are embedded in space. Transportation and mobility networks, Internet, mobile phone networks, power grids, social and contact networks, and neural networks, are all examples where space is relevant and where topology alone does not contain all the information. Characterizing and understanding the structure and the evolution of spatial networks is thus crucial for many different fields, ranging from urbanism to epidemiology. An important consequence of space on networks is that there is a cost associated with the length of edges which in turn has dramatic effects on the topological structure of these networks. We will thoroughly explain the current state of our understanding of how the spatial constraints affect the structure and properties of these networks. We will review the most recent empirical observations and the most important models of spatial networks. We will also discuss various processes which take place on these spatial networks, such as phase transitions, random walks, synchronization, navigation, resilience, and disease spread.},

	abstract = {The origin of large but rare cascades that are triggered by small initial shocks is a phenomenon that manifests itself as diversely as cultural fads, collective action, the diffusion of norms and innovations, and cascading failures in infrastructure and organizational networks. This paper presents a possible explanation of this phenomenon in terms of a sparse, random network of interacting agents whose decisions are determined by the actions of their neighbors according to a simple threshold rule. Two regimes are identified in which the network is susceptible to very large cascades-herein called global cascades-that occur very rarely. When cascade propagation is limited by the connectivity of the network, a power law distribution of cascade sizes is observed, analogous to the cluster size distribution in standard percolation theory and avalanches in self-organized criticality. But when the network is highly connected, cascade propagation is limited instead by the local stability of the nodes themselves, and the size distribution of cascades is bimodal, implying a more extreme kind of instability that is correspondingly harder to anticipate. In the first regime, where the distribution of network neighbors is highly skewed, it is found that the most connected nodes are far more likely than average nodes to trigger cascades, but not in the second regime. Finally, it is shown that heterogeneity plays an ambiguous role in determining a system's stability: increasingly heterogeneous thresholds make the system more vulnerable to global cascades; but an increasingly heterogeneous degree distribution makes it less vulnerable.},

In particular, numerous recent studies have lead to an unexpected consensus: the considerable variability in the characteristic travelled distance of individuals coexists with a high degree of predictability of their future locations. Here we shed light on this surprising coexistence by systematically investigating the impact of recurrent mobility on the characteristic distance travelled by individuals. Using both mobile phone and {GPS} data, we discover the existence of two distinct classes of individuals: returners and explorers. As existing models of human mobility cannot explain the existence of these two classes, we develop more realistic models able to capture the empirical findings. Finally, we show that returners and explorers play a distinct quantifiable role in spreading phenomena and that a correlation exists between their mobility patterns and social interactions.},

	abstract = {In the so-called "microscopic" models of vehicular traffic, attention is paid explicitly to each individual vehicle each of which is represented by a "particle"; the nature of the "interactions" among these particles is determined by the way the vehicles influence each others' movement. Therefore, vehicular traffic, modeled as a system of interacting "particles" driven far from equilibrium, offers the possibility to study various fundamental aspects of truly nonequilibrium systems which are of current interest in statistical physics. Analytical as well as numerical techniques of statistical physics are being used to study these models to understand rich variety of physical phenomena exhibited by vehicular traffic. Some of these phenomena, observed in vehicular traffic under different circumstances, include transitions from one dynamical phase to another, criticality and self-organized criticality, metastability and hysteresis, phase-segregation, etc. In this critical review, written from the perspective of statistical physics, we explain the guiding principles behind all the main theoretical approaches.

While expected travel costs are reduced by perfectly informing all drivers about route capacities, this is not necessarily the case if imperfect information is provided. A heuristic explanation is that, absent tolls, congestion is an uninternalized externality.

These highly interconnected systems have recently been the focus of a great deal of attention that has uncovered and characterized their topological complexity. Along with a complex topological structure, real networks display a large heterogeneity in the capacity and intensity of the connections. These features, however, have mainly not been considered in past studies where links are usually represented as binary states, i.e., either present or absent. Here, we study the scientific collaboration network and the world-wide air-transportation network, which are representative examples of social and large infrastructure systems, respectively. In both cases it is possible to assign to each edge of the graph a weight proportional to the intensity or capacity of the connections among the various elements of the network. We define appropriate metrics combining weighted and topological observables that enable us to characterize the complex statistical properties and heterogeneity of the actual strength of edges and vertices. This information allows us to investigate the correlations among weighted quantities and the underlying topological structure of the network. These results provide a better description of the hierarchies and organizational principles at the basis of the architecture of weighted networks.},

First, the problem of maintaining reliable and consistent injectivity by avoiding precipitation of dissolved solids. Injectivity loss has been prevented in some fields, but not in all. The second problem is that of determining where the reinjected water goes, in order to analyse the likely behaviour of the system before productivity difficulties begin. In this regard tracers are the most important reservoir engineering tool, and the collective worldwide experience in their use is summarized in tables. The third problem is that of loss of production performance due to invasion of reinjected water, as has occurred in several highly fractured fields. Early recognition of this difficulty is the major purpose of tracer testing; however, the complete interpretation of these tests remains one of the most significant outstanding problems in reservoir engineering. These three aspects of the reinjection problem are discussed in detail and the current status of reservoir engineering approach to these problems is summarized.

	abstract = {Since the subject of traffic dynamics has captured the interest of physicists, many surprising effects have been revealed and explained. Some of the questions now understood are the following: Why are vehicles sometimes stopped by "phantom traffic jams" even though drivers all like to drive fast? What are the mechanisms behind stop-and-go traffic? Why are there several different kinds of congestion, and how are they related? Why do most traffic jams occur considerably before the road capacity is reached? Can a temporary reduction in the volume of traffic cause a lasting traffic jam? Under which conditions can speed limits speed up traffic? Why do pedestrians moving in opposite directions normally organize into lanes, while similar systems "freeze by heating"? All of these questions have been answered by applying and extending methods from statistical physics and nonlinear dynamics to self-driven many-particle systems. This article considers the empirical data and then reviews the main approaches to modeling pedestrian and vehicle traffic. These include microscopic (particle-based), mesoscopic (gas-kinetic), and macroscopic (fluid-dynamic) models. Attention is also paid to the formulation of a micro-macro link, to aspects of universality, and to other unifying concepts, such as a general modeling framework for self-driven many-particle systems, including spin systems. While the primary focus is upon vehicle and pedestrian traffic, applications to biological or socio-economic systems such as bacterial colonies, flocks of birds, panics, and stock market dynamics are touched upon as well.},

	abstract = {Development of numerical methods for hydraulic fracture simulation has accelerated in the past two decades. Recent advances in hydraulic fracture modeling and simulation are driven by increased industry and research activity in oil and gas, a drive toward consideration of more complex behaviors associated with layered and naturally-fractured rock formations, and a deepening understanding of the underlying mathematical model and its intrinsic challenges. Here we review the basic approaches being employed. Some of these comprise enhancements of classical methods, while others are imported from other fields of mechanics but are completely new in their application to hydraulic fracturing. After a description of the intrinsic challenges associated with the mechanics of fluid-driven fractures, we discuss both continuum and meso-scales numerical methods as well as engineering models which typically make use of additional assumptions to reduce computational cost. We pay particular attention to the verification and validation of numerical models, which is increasingly enabled by an ever-expanding library of laboratory experiments and analytical solutions for simple geometries in a number of different propagation regimes. A number of challenges remain and are amplified with a drive toward fully-coupled, three-dimensional hydraulic fracture modeling that accounts for host-rock heterogeneity. In the context of such a drive to complex models, we argue that the importance of best-practice development that includes careful verification and validation is vital to ensure progress is constrained by the appropriate underlying physics and mathematics with a constant attention to identifying conditions under which simpler models suffice for the intended modeling purposes.},

One component, superhighways, is the infinite incipient percolation cluster, for which we find that nodes (or links) with high centrality dominate. For the other component, roads, which includes the remaining nodes, low centrality nodes dominate. We find also that the distribution of the centrality for the infinite incipient percolation cluster satisfies a power law, with an exponent smaller than that for the entire {MST}.

Implicit in this description is the assumption that contacts can be approximated as ideal thermal reservoirs which act solely to thermalise incident electrons before re-injecting them into the device. We describe two classes of experiment where this assumption is not valid. First, when the dissipation in the system is strongly dependent on an external parameter, such as temperature or magnetic field, the physical position of the contact may itself depend the parameter. We study this by investigating the transport properties of quantum wires with disordered contacts. Second, when there is the possibility of some sort of interaction between the electrons in the contact and those in the device, as we find in resonant tunnelling from a 2D contact into a 0D state. In both cases we find that the conductance properties of the device are strongly modified by the nature of the contact. {PACS}: 73.40.Kp, 73.40.Hm, 73.40Gk. © 1994 Academic Press.

From the numerical simulation, we find that tensile fracturing occurs discontinuously in time, which generates saw-toothed responses of pressure, the fracture aperture, and displacement, and that fracture propagation is sensitive to factors such as initial condition of saturation, a type of the injection fluid, heterogeneity, tensile strength, elastic moduli, and permeability models. Gas injection induces faster fracturing in shale gas reservoirs than water injection, for the same mass injection, because of high mobility of gas. However, water injection to highly water-saturated formations can contribute to fast pressurization and high mobility of water, resulting in large fracturing. For moderate initial water saturation, complex physical responses within the fracture result from strong nonlinear permeability and multiphase flow with gravity. Pressure diffusion and pressurization within the fracture are also affected by permeability. High intrinsic and high relative permeabilities result in fast fluid movement of injected fluid, followed by fast fracturing. High Young[U+05F3]s modulus and high Poisson[U+05F3]s ratio do not seem favorable to fracture propagation, although they are not significantly sensitive. For heterogeneity, a geological layer of high strength between near surface and above the shale gas reservoirs can prevent vertical fracture propagation, changing the direction of fracturing horizontally.},

We also focus on the sorts of considerations that may be necessary to move statistical physics from the description of idealized flows in the limit of zero Reynolds number to more realistic flows of real fluids moving at a nonzero velocity, when inertia effects may become relevant.

	abstract = {In this article, the effects of different diverging-converging pore geometries were investigated, and the microscale fluid flow and effective hydraulic properties from these pores were compared with that of a pipe from viscous to inertial laminar flow regimes. The flow fields are obtained using computational fluid dynamics, and the comparative analysis is based on a new dimensionless hydraulic shape factor β, which is the "specific surface" scaled by the length of pores. Results from all diverging-converging pores show an inverse pattern in velocity and vorticity distributions relative to the pipe flow. The hydraulic conductivity K of all pores is dependent on and can be predicted from β with a power function with an exponent of 3/2. The differences in K are due to the differences in distribution of local friction drag on the pore walls. At Reynolds number (Re) ∼ 0 flows, viscous eddies are found to exist almost in all pores in different sizes, but not in the pipe. Eddies grow when Re →1 and leads to the failure of Darcy's law. During non-Darcy or Forchheimer flows, the apparent hydraulic conductivity Ka decreases due to the growth of eddies, which constricts the bulk flow region. At Re{\textgreater}1, the rate of decrease in Ka increases, and at Re ≫ 1, it decreases to where the change in Ka ≈ 0, and flows once again exhibits a Darcy-type relationship. The degree of nonlinearity during non-Darcy flow decreases for pores with increasing β. The nonlinear flow behavior becomes weaker as β increases to its maximum value in the pipe, which shows no nonlinearity in the flow; in essence, Darcy's law stays valid in the pipe at all laminar flow conditions. The diverging-converging geometry in pores plays a critical role in modifying the intrapore fluid flow, implying that this property should be incorporated in effective larger-scale models, e.g., pore-network models. © 2013.

	abstract = {Flow fields within spatially periodic arrays of cylinders arranged in square and hexagonal lattices are calculated, with microscale Reynolds number ranging between zero and 200, employing a finite element numerical scheme. The terminology of an "apparent permeability" is introduced to establish a relationship existing between mean velocity and macroscopic pressure gradient characterized by a finite Reynolds number flow. In contrast with the low Reynolds number "true" permeability, the apparent permeability is shown here to generally depend upon the direction of the applied pressure gradient, owing to nonlinearities existing within the local fluid motion. The orientation-dependent permeabilities of both square and hexagonal monodisperse arrays are observed to diminish with increasing Reynolds number. Similar behavior is also observed for a bidisperse square array, though the apparent permeability of the latter is shown less sensitive to Darcy velocity orientation at large Reynolds numbers in comparison to the corresponding monodisperse square array, for all cylinder concentrations examined. © 1989 American Institute of Physics.},

	doi = {10.1088/1742-2132/2/1/006},
	abstract = {Roughness and aperture are two important characteristic parameters controlling fluid flow in natural joints and fractures. It has been demonstrated by many authors that knowledge of roughness does not directly lead to that of aperture, and aperture should be handled as a separate geometrical descriptor. To determine the normal deformability and flow response of a fracture, the aperture distribution and the mechanical properties of the rock matrix are required. When shearing of joints and fractures is considered, roughness comes into play and affects the evolution of the aperture distribution. The aperture distribution can be evaluated by knowing the correlation between the asperity profiles of the rock walls of a rock fracture. Thus, the distributions of contact area and void space determine the fracture dilation and hydraulic properties during shearing. In the seismic characterization of fractured reservoirs, various equivalent medium theories describing the effective elastic properties of fractured media have been proposed. One relatively simple theory is based on the assumption of the linear slip interface or displacement discontinuity model of fractures. Two parameters are usually used in the linear slip interface model: the normal and shear fracture compliances defined as the ratio of normal (shear) displacement discontinuity and normal (shear) stress. Fracture compliances are by definition functions of mechanical aperture and are also influenced by the roughness (surface asperity distribution) of fracture surfaces. In this study, I investigate the effects of fracture roughness and apertures on the hydraulic and mechanical properties of fractured rock. Specifically, I focus on two kinds of fracture models which are commonly used in describing the effective hydraulic and mechanical (elastic) response of natural fractures. The first is the rough-walled fracture model and the second is an interface with distributions of contacts and voids (called the asperity fracture model). © 2005 Nanjing Institute of Geophysical Prospecting.},

This study examines the effects of surface roughness on fracture flow and proposes a new, triple-effect permeability estimation model that takes surface and hydraulic tortuosity other than surface roughness factor ({SRF}) into account according to the functioning patterns. Due to the scale effect on hydraulic and surface tortuosities, it can also be reformulated into a scaling aperture-permeability equation for a self-affine fracture. Results indicate that tortuosity effects are scaled by 4(H-1) (H is the Hurst exponent) with the mean aperture and that the local {SRF}, as expected, is stationary at the measurement scale of the mean aperture. In addition, based on the scaling equation and the size effect of self-affine objects, flow regimes are examined and three flow regimes are then identified. Consequently, different permeability models for these regimes are established by fabricating fundamental and well-defined physical properties. The estimation results from these models are in excellent agreement with results from lattice Boltzmann simulations.},

	doi = {10.1007/PL00012554},
	abstract = {There are currently three major competing views on the essential geometrical, mechanical, and mathematical nature of faults. The standard view is that faults are (possibly segmented and heterogeneous) Euclidean zones in a continuum solid. The continuum-Euclidean view is supported by seismic, gravity, and electromagnetic imaging studies; by successful modeling of observed seismic radiation, geodetic data, and changes in seismicity patterns; by detailed field studies of earthquake rupture zones and exhumed faults; and by recent high resolution hypocenter distributions along several faults. The second view focuses on granular aspects of fault structures and deformation fields. The granular view is supported by observations of rock particles in fault zone gouge; by studies of block rotations and the mosaic structure of the lithosphere (which includes the overall geometry of plate tectonics); by concentration of deformation signals along block boundaries; by correlation of seismicity patterns on scales several times larger than those compatible with a continuum framework; and by strongly heterogeneous wave propagation effects on the earth's surface. The third view is that faults are fractal objects with rough surfaces and branching geometry. The fractal view is supported by some statistical analysis of regional hypocenter locations; by long-range correlation of various measurements in geophysical boreholes; by the fact that observed power-law statistics of earthquakes are compatible with an underlying scale-invariant geometrical structure; by geometrical analysis of fault traces at the earth's surface; and by measurements of joint and fault surfaces topography. There are several overlaps between expected phenomenology in continuum-Euclidean, granular, and fractal frameworks of crustal deformation. As examples, highly heterogeneous seismic wavefields can be generated by granular media, by fractal structures, and by ground motion amplification around and scattering from an ensemble of Euclidean fault zones. A hierarchical granular structure may have fractal geometry. Power-law statistics of earthquakes can be generated by slip on one or more heterogeneous planar faults, by a fractal collection of faults, and by deformation of granular material. Each of the three frameworks can produce complex spatio-temporal patterns of earthquakes and faults. At present the existing data cannot distinguish unequivocally between the three different views on the nature of fault zones or determine their scale of relevance. However, in each observational category, the highest resolution results associated with mature large-displacement faults are compatible with the standard continuum-Euclidean framework. This can be explained by a positive feedback mechanism associated with strain weakening rheology and localization, which attracts the long-term evolution of faults toward progressive regularization and Euclidean geometry. A negative feedback mechanism associated with strain hardening during initial deformation phases and around persisting geometrical irregularities and conjugate sets of faults generates new fractures and granularity at different scales. We conclude that long-term deformation in the crust, including many aspects of the observed spatio-temporal complexity of earthquakes and faults, may be explained to first order within the continuum-Euclidean framework.},

Numerical simulations of shear-flow tests under different normal stresses were performed on a series of 3D rough fractures generated using the modified successive random additions ({SRA}) algorithm, and the evolutions of aperture and permeability were investigated. The results show that joint roughness coefficient ({JRC}) distribution of fracture profiles follows a Gauss function, where {JRC} is an extensively accepted parameter for characterizing fracture surface roughness in rock mechanics and rock engineering. As the shear displacement increases, aperture distribution becomes more anisotropic and more complex channels of fluid flow are formed. Permeability decreases with the increase in normal stress. For a smaller normal stress, the change of permeability is more significant because of the larger dilation inhibited by a larger normal stress. Due to the significant flow channels induced by shearing, the permeability in the direction perpendicular to the shear direction is approximately 1.12–10.98 times as large as that in the direction parallel to the shear direction. The validity of the proposed functions for permeability prediction is verified by comparisons with reported results in previous works. In practice, the permeability can be well calculated as a first-order estimation using the proposed model when the parameters such as {JRC}, shear displacement and normal stress are given.},

	abstract = {The extension of the concepts of Fractal Geometry (Mandelbrot [1983]) toward the life sciences has led to significant progress in understand- ing complex functional properties and architectural / morphological / struc- tural features characterising cells and tissues during ontogenesis and both normal and pathological development processes. It has even been argued that fractal geometry could provide a coherent description of the design principles underlying living organisms (Weibel [1991]). Fractals fulfil a certain number of theoretical and methodological criteria including a high level oforganization, shape irregularity, functional and morphological self-similar- ity, scale invariance, iterative pathways and a peculiar non-integer fractal dimension [{FD}]. Whereas mathematical objects are deterministic invariant or self-similar over an unlimited range of scales, biological components are statistically self-similar only within a fractal domain defined by upper and lower limits, called scaling window, in which the relationship between the scale of observation and the measured size or length of the object can be es- tablished (Losa and Nonnenmacher [1996]). Selected examples will contrib- ute to depict complex biological shapes and structures as fractal entities, and also to show why the application of the fractal principle is valuable for meas- uring dimensional, geometrical and functional parameters of cells, tissues and organs occurring within the vegetal and animal realms. If the criteria for a strict description of natural fractals are met, then it follows that a Fractal Geometry of Life may be envisaged and all natural objects and bio- logical systems exhibiting self-similar patterns and scaling properties may be considered as belonging to the new subdiscipline of “fractalomics”.},

Numerical simulations have been carried out by applying Darcy's law to the rock joint, described as an equivalent porous medium. The numerical simulations are based on experimental data obtained by Hans ({PhD}, Grenoble, 2002) from a series of hydromechanical shear tests on a rock joint replica. The numerical results have been compared to the experimental ones, and to the results obtained by applying the Reynolds equation, to assess the relevance of the simulations.

An idealized model of a fracture, in which the roughness follows a sinusoidal variation, is studied in detail. This fracture is considered to consist of a random mixture of elements in which the fluid flows either parallel or transverse to the sinusoidal bumps. The overall permeability is then found by a suitable averaging procedure. The results are similar to those found by other researchers from numerical analysis of the Reynolds equation, in that the ratio of the hydraulic aperture to the mean aperture correlates well with the ratio of the mean aperture to the standard deviation of the aperture. Higher-order approximations to the Navier-Stokes equations for flow between sinusoidal walls are then studied, and it is concluded that in order for the lubrication approximation to be valid, the fracture walls must be smooth over lengths on the order of one standard deviation of the aperture, which is much less restrictive a condition than had previously been thought to apply. © 1991.},

To explore discrete fracture flow, we conducted a series of experiments to study the movement of water through four artificial fractures, each with a different two-dimensional surface topography. We then performed fluid flow simulations using a lattice gas automata ({LGA}) numerical model to compare with the experimental results and to obtain detailed pictures of the fluid velocity fields within these fractures. The flow experiments and {LGA} simulations, all performed under fully saturated and laminar flow conditions, used fracture aperture values ranging from 0.25 to 1.80 mm. Our main focus was to determine how the cubic law, derived for fluid flow through parallel plates, could be modified to accommodate a tortuous fracture geometry. Our experimental and numerical results led to the proposal of a new conceptual model. This model states that when the aperture is measured normal to the flow path and is harmonically averaged and when the tortuosity of the flow path is included in the calculation of the pressure gradient, the cubic law can adequately predict the flow rate through fractures with a nonparallel geometry.

Combining the stochastic cubic law with a simple deformation model results in a nonlinear relationship between fracture hydraulic and mechanical aperture. This relationship is shown to be consistent with published experimental and numerical data above a critical minimum aperture.

Surface topography of the samples is quantified through a newly designed fully automated device. Before the application, self-affinity of the surface roughness and the applicability of these methods are validated using synthetically generated fractal surfaces. Fractal dimension values of the profiles are obtained as between 1 and 1.5 with a few exceptions. {VA} and {RMS} methods yield consistent fractal dimensions while the {PSD} values are lower than those of the other two methods. In terms of practical applicability, the {VA} is found more convenient than other two methods because there still exists shortcomings with the {PSD} and {RMS} methods due to difficulties in the mathematical analysis of the plots whose slopes are used in the computation of fractal dimension. However, it is observed that the data of limited size fracture surfaces are convenient for fractal analysis and the results are promising for further applications if the fracture surface size is restricted like cores recovered from deep boreholes.},

The effects of non-linearity in flow have been investigated by analyzing hydraulic tests on an artificially created fractured rock sample of parallelepiped (0.60 × 0.40 × 0.8 m) shape. brbr The volumes of water passing through different paths across the fractured sample for various hydraulic head differences have been measured, and the results of the experiments have been reported as specific flow rate vs. head gradient. The experimental results closely match the Forchheimer equation and describe a strong inertial regime. The results of the test have been interpreted by means of numerical simulations. For each pair of ports, several steady-state simulations have been carried out varying the hydraulic head difference between the inlet and outlet ports. The estimated linear and non-linear Forchheimer coefficients have been correlated to each other and respectively to the tortuosity of the flow paths. A correlation among the linear and non-linear Forchheimer coefficients is evident. Moreover, a tortuosity factor that influences flow dynamics has been determined. © Author(s) 2013.},

The curves describing the evolution of the hydraulic aperture as a function of the mean fracture separation are shown to be well fitted by power law functions. A grid rotation technique is developed to explore the influence of the pressure drop orientation over a continuous range of orientations. A single fracture is shown to be either flow enhancing or flow inhibiting by comparison to a parallel plate model of identical mean separation, depending on the pressure drop orientation. This anisotropy of the fluid flow results from the geometrical heterogeneities at the fracture scale. Statistical analyses of the results when exploring different apertures distributions with the same measured scale invariance property show a large variability of the permeability, which is due to the same phenomenon. A prediction of the hydraulic transmittivity that takes account of the pressure drop orientation is proposed. Copyright 2001 by the American Geophysical Union.},

	abstract = {Fractures are the key channels for fluid flow and mass transport in fractured rocks of low/negligible matrix permeability. In single rock fractures, surface roughness causes fluid flow in tortuous paths, and reduces the overall fracture conductance. A number of empirical models have been proposed to relate the reduced hydraulic aperture to the mechanical aperture due to surface roughness, which were revisited and compared. Using two of those relationships between hydraulic apertures and mechanical apertures, we studied the influences of local surface roughness of fractures on fluid flow and solute transport processes at the macroscopic scales of fracture networks. The results show that fracture roughness can affect the flow rates and residence time to varying extent, mainly depending on the empirical models between hydraulic apertures and mechanical apertures. However, fracture roughness has negligible influences on the general patterns of fluid flow (channeling) and solute migration (e.g., travel paths and shape of breakthrough curves). This is because the connectivity of a fracture network is mainly determined by other geometrical parameters (fracture positions, orientations, and lengths), rather than roughness or apertures.},

	abstract = {This paper studies the problem of hydrodynamic dispersion of a tracer in a fluid flowing through a two-dimensional rough channel bounded by self-affine surfaces. Changing the surface roughness exponent H, rough walls having different microstructure are obtained. In order to simulate hydrodynamics, a lattice-gas automata modified to introduce two different species of particles is used. In the studied range of Péclet numbers (20-50), the concentration profiles along the channel are well described by Gaussian-type dispersion. A clear enhancement of the dispersion due to roughness is observed. For the studied regime of Péclet numbers, a simple approach is proposed which allows us to interpret the dispersion enhancement in terms of surface roughness. It is shown that the dispersion enhancement in the rough channel is due to the presence of two characteristic lengths, the hydraulic diameter δHwhich determines the velocity in the channel and the average aperture δavwhich determines the transverse diffusion length; next shown is that the dispersion in the rough channel varies as D∥∼(δav/δH)2. The values of δHobtained from the dispersion results are compared with those obtained from permeability measures and a good agreement is observed. In the studied domain of Péclet numbers, the roughness exponent H has only a weak influence on the dispersion. © 1995 American Institute of Physics.},

By a combination of order-of-magnitude analysis, appeal to available analytical solutions, and reanalysis of some data from the literature, it is shown that the Navier-Stokes equations can be linearized if the Reynolds number is less than about 10. Further analysis shows that the linear Stokes equations can be replaced by the simpler Reynolds lubrication equation if the wavelength of the dominant aperture variations is about three times greater than the mean aperture. However, this criterion does not seem to be strongly obeyed by all fractures. The Reynolds equation (i.e., the local cubic law) may therefore suffice in estimating fracture permeabilities to within a factor of about 2, but more accurate estimates will require solution of the Stokes equations. Similarly, estimates of mean aperture based on inverting transmissivity data may have errors of a factor of two if any version of the local cubic law is used to relate transmissivity to mean aperture.},

	abstract = {In this paper we study fluid flow in fractures using numerical simulation and address the challenging issue of hydraulic property characterization in fractures. The methodology is based on Computational Fluid Dynamics, using a finite-volume based discretization scheme. Steady-state, viscous, laminar flow simulations for a Newtonian fluid are carried out in both 2D and 3D fracture models. In 2D, flow is analyzed in single fractures, series and parallel combination of fractures, inclined fractures, intersecting fractures, mixed networks, and in real (rough-surface) fractures. In 3D, flow is simulated in both uniform and variable aperture fracture models. To characterize each fracture model with an equivalent hydraulic aperture, equations are derived for all possible scenarios followed by comparison and validation with results derived from flow simulation. Based on the fracture models analyzed, the following are some of the important findings: 1) For fractures connected in series, the equivalent hydraulic aperture is a weighted harmonic mean of cubed apertures of all fractures. 2) For fractures connected in parallel, the equivalent flow is simply the sum of all flows through individual fractures. 3) If a fracture is inclined with respect to the axis of pressure gradient, then the amount of flow will be reduced by a factor of cosine of the inclination angle. 4) Any network of randomly intersecting fractures can be replaced by a single fracture to give flow equivalence; the aperture of that equivalent fracture will roughly be close to the aperture of the fracture in the network that cuts across the boundaries (inlet and outlet) in the most continuous fashion and have the smallest inclination (with respect to the pressure gradient axis). 5) For hydraulic characterization purposes, fluid flow in fractures can be sufficiently modeled using both Stokes and Navier-Stokes equations for flow Reynolds number upto approximately 100.},

	abstract = {A numerical fracture flow simulation based on the lubrication approximation is used to investigate the influence of roughness on the flow inside a rough fracture, at low Reynolds number. Facing surfaces are described as self-affine topographies with identical roughness magnitude. Resolution of the Reynolds equation is achieved using two distinct numerical schemes, with consistency. Fracture closure is studied assuming perfect plastic contact between facing surfaces. Long-range correlations are shown to exist in the local aperture field due to the fracture geometry and subsequently in the local fluxes inside the fracture. Flow channeling is the result of these correlations in terms of spatial distribution of the flow, and is responsible for either flow-enhancing or flow-inhibiting behaviour of the fracture. Matching between the two surfaces at scales larger than a mismatch scale is studied. The mismatch scale is the upper limit scale for the local apertures scale invariance. It appears to control flow channeling and the related dispersion of the possible behaviors over a large statistics of fractures with identical statistical features. Hydraulic anisotropy of a given fracture is investigated: the dependence of the fracture transmittivity on the pressure drop orientation is proved to be sinusoidal, with an amplitude that is controlled by the mismatch scale.},

	abstract = {Information technologies today can inform each of us about the route with the shortest time, but they do not contain incentives to manage travellers such that we all get collective benefits in travel times. To that end we need travel demand estimates and target strategies to reduce the traffic volume from the congested roads during peak hours in a feasible way. During large events, the traffic inconveniences in large cities are unusually high, yet temporary, and the entire population may be more willing to adopt collective recommendations for collective benefits in traffic. In this paper, we integrate, for the first time, big data resources to estimate the impact of events on traffic and propose target strategies for collective good at the urban scale. In the context of the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, we first predict the expected increase in traffic. To that end, we integrate data from mobile phones, Airbnb, Waze and transit information, with game schedules and expected attendance in each venue. Next, we evaluate different route choice scenarios for drivers during the peak hours. Finally, we gather information on the trips that contribute the most to the global congestion which could be redirected from vehicles to transit. Interestingly, we show that (i) following new route alternatives during the event with individual shortest times can save more collective travel time than keeping the routine routes used before the event, uncovering the positive value of information technologies during events; (ii) with only a small proportion of people selected from specific areas switching from driving to public transport, the collective travel time can be reduced to a great extent.

	abstract = {Cascading failures have become major threats to network robustness due to their potential catastrophic consequences, where local perturbations can induce global propagation of failures. Unlike failures spreading via direct contacts due to structural interdependencies, overload failures usually propagate through collective interactions among system components. Despite the critical need in developing protection or mitigation strategies in networks such as power grids and transportation, the propagation behavior of cascading failures is essentially unknown. Here we find by analyzing our collected data that jams in city traffic and faults in power grid are spatially long-range correlated with correlations decaying slowly with distance. Moreover, we find in the daily traffic, that the correlation length increases dramatically and reaches maximum, when morning or evening rush hour is approaching. Our study can impact all efforts towards improving actively system resilience ranging from evaluation of design schemes, development of protection strategies to implementation of mitigation programs.},

On the one hand, scientists have to cope with structural issues, such as characterizing the topology of a complex wiring architecture, revealing the unifying principles that are at the basis of real networks, and developing models to mimic the growth of a network and reproduce its structural properties. On the other hand, many relevant questions arise when studying complex networks' dynamics, such as learning how a large ensemble of dynamical systems that interact through a complex wiring topology can behave collectively.

The combined finitediscrete element method ({FDEM}) proposed by Munjiza is an innovative numerical technique to capture progressive damage and failure processes in rock. However, it cannot model the fracturing process of rock driven by hydraulic pressure. In this study, we present a coupled hydro-mechanical model based on {FDEM} for the simulation of hydraulic fracturing in complex fracture geometries, where an algorithm for updating hydraulic fracture network is proposed. The algorithm can carry out connectivity searches for arbitrarily complex fracture networks. Then, we develop a new combined finite-discrete element method numerical code (Y-flow) for the simulation of hydraulic fracturing. Finally, several verification examples are given, and the simulation results agree well with the analytical or experimental results, indicating that the newly developed numerical code can capture hydraulic fracturing process correctly and effectively.},

This paper outlines a new solution strategy that couples lattice Boltzmann ({LB}), large eddy simulation ({LES}), and discrete element ({DE}) methodologies for the simulation of particle-fluid systems at moderately high Reynolds numbers. The following main computational issues are considered: (1) the use of the standard {LB} formulation for the solution of fluid flows; (2) the incorporation of the one-parameter Smagorinski turbulence model in the {LB} equations for turbulent flows; (3) the utilisation of one immersed boundary scheme for computing hydrodynamic interaction forces between the fluid and moving particles; and (4) the use of {DE} methods accounting for the interaction between solid particles. The new contributions made in the current work include the application of the Smagorinski turbulence model to moving particles and the proposal of a subcycling time integration scheme for the {DE} modelling in order to ensure an overall stable {LB}-{DE} solution. A complex transport problem involving 70 large moving particles with moderately high Reynolds number (around 56,000) is provided to demonstrate the capability of the presented coupling strategy. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Wells are seldom modeled explicitly in large scale finite difference reservoir simulations. Instead, the well is coupled to the reservoir through the use of a well index, which relates wellbore flow rate and pressure to grid block quantities. The use of an accurate well index is essential for the detailed modeling of nonconventional wells; i.e., wells with an arbitrary trajectory or multiple branches. The determination of a well index for such problems is complicated, particularly when the simulation grid is irregular or unstructured. In this work, a general framework for the calculation of accurate well indices for general nonconventional wells on arbitrary grids is presented and applied. The method entails the use of an accurate semianalytical well model based on Green's functions as a reference single phase flow solution. This result is coupled with a finite difference calculation to provide an accurate well index for each grid block containing a well segment. The method is demonstrated on a number of homogeneous example cases involving deviated, horizontal and multilateral wells oriented skew to the grid. Both Cartesian and globally unstructured multiblock grids are considered. In all these cases, the method is shown to provide results that are considerably more accurate compared to results using standard procedures. The method is also applied to heterogeneous problems involving horizontal wells, where it is shown to be capable of approximating the effects of subgrid heterogeneity in coarse finite difference models.},

It takes into account the efects of fluid flow inside the fracture, fluid leak-off through fracture walls and elastic response of the surrounding porous media. Finite element techniques are adopted for the discretization of the conservation law of fluid flow and the singular integral equation relating the traction and the fracture opening. The discrete model for the singular integral equation is implemented using a stencil matrix structure allowing an efficient implementation of the fluid-structure interaction problem. Newton's method combined with {GMRES} linear solver are used to solve the resulting nonlinear set of equations. An algorithm for fracture propagation is proposed which is based on the balance of the amount of fluid transported to a certain point with the amount of fluid that could be lost by leak-off.

We first summarize the available simulation methods for colloidal suspensions together with some of the important applications of these methods, and then describe results from lattice-gas and lattice-Boltzmann simulations in more detail. The remainder of the paper is an update of previously published work,(69,70) taking into account recent research by ourselves and other groups. We describe a lattice-Boltzmann model that can take proper account of density fluctuations in the fluid, which may be important in describing the short-time dynamics of colloidal particles. We then derive macrodynamical equations for a collision operator with separate shear and bulk viscosities, via the usual multi-time-scale expansion. A careful examination of the second-order equations shows that inclusion of an external force, such as a pressure gradient, requires terms that depend on the eigenvalues of the collision operator. Alternatively, the momentum density must be redefined to include a contribution from the external force. Next, we summarize recent innovations and give a few numerical examples to illustrate critical issues. Finally, we derive the equations for a lattice-Boltzmann model that includes transverse and longitudinal fluctuations in momentum. The model leads to a discrete version of the Green-Kubo relations for the shear and bulk viscosity, which agree with the viscosities obtained from the macro-dynamical analysis. We believe that inclusion of longitudinal fluctuations will improve the equipartition of energy in lattice-Boltzmann simulations of colloidal suspensions.},

According to the results, shale reservoir flow ability for gas movement may reduce with increasing injection pressure and reservoir depth, due to the Klinkenberg phenomenon and pore structure shrinkage, respectively. The breakdown pressure of the reservoir rock linearly increases with increasing reservoir depth (confining pressure). Interestingly, 81\% permeability reduction was observed in the fractured rock mass due to high (25 {MPa}) confinement, which shows the importance of proppants in the fracturing process.},

Inside fractures, fluid transport is calculated on the finest scale and found to be localized in channels as a consequence of the aperture field. The channel network is characterized and reduced to a vectorized artificial channel network ({ACN}). Different realizations of {ACNs} are used to systematically calculate efficient apertures for fluid transport inside differently sized fractures as well as fracture intersection and entry properties. Typical situations in fracture networks are parameterized by fracture inclination, flow path length along the fracture and intersection lengths in the entrance and outlet zones of fractures. Using these scaling relations obtained from the finer scales, we simulate the invasion process of immiscible fluids into saturated discrete fracture networks, which were studied in previous works.},

	abstract = {This part will get you started in thinking about designing and analyzing algorithms. It is intended to be a gentle introduction to how we specify algorithms, some of the design strategies we will use throughout this book, and many of the fundamental ideas used in algorithm analysis. Later parts of this book will build upon this base. Chapter 1 is an overview of algorithms and their place in modern computing systems. This chapter defines what an algorithm is and lists some examples. It also makes a case that algorithms are a technology, just as are fast hardware, graphical user interfaces, object-oriented systems, and networks. In Chapter 2, we see our first algorithms, which solve the problem of sorting a sequence of n numbers. They are written in a pseudocode which, although not directly translatable to any conventional programming language, conveys the structure of the algorithm clearly enough that a competent programmer can implement it in the language of his choice. The sorting algorithms we examine are insertion sort, which uses an incremental approach, and merge sort, which uses a recursive technique known as divide and conquer. Although the time each requires increases with the value of n, the rate of increase differs between the two algorithms. We determine these running times in Chapter 2, and we develop a useful notation to express them. Chapter 3 precisely defines this notation, which we call asymptotic notation. It starts by defining several asymptotic notations, which we use for bounding algorithm running times from above and/or below. The rest of Chapter 3 is primarily a presentation of mathematical notation. Its purpose is more to ensure that your use of notation matches that in this book than to teach you new mathematical concepts.},

	abstract = {This paper studies the effect of cascading failures in the risk and reliability assessment of complex infrastructure systems. Conventional reliability assessment for these systems is limited to finding paths between predefined components and does not include the effect of increased flow demand or flow capacity. Network flows are associated with congestion-based disruptions which can worsen path-based predictions of performance. In this research, overloads due to cascading failures are modeled with a tolerance parameter α that measures network element flow capacity relative to flow demands in practical power transmission systems. Natural hazards and malevolent targeted disruptions constitute the triggering events that evolve into widespread failures due to flow redistribution. It is observed that improvements in network component tolerance alone do not ensure system robustness or protection against disproportionate cascading failures. Topological changes are needed to increase cascading robustness at realistic tolerance levels. Interestingly, targeted topological disruptions of a small fraction of network components can affect system-level performance more severely than earthquake or lightning events that trigger similar fractions of element failure. Also, regardless of the nature of the hazards, once the triggering events that disrupt the networks under investigation occur, the additional loss of performance due to cascading failures can be orders of magnitude larger than the initial loss of performance. These results reinforce the notion that managing the risk of network unavailability requires a combination of redundant topology, increased flow carrying capacity, and other non-conventional consequence reduction strategies, such as layout homogenization and the deliberate inclusion of weak links for network islanding. Furthermore, accepted ideas that rare loss of performance events occur exponentially less frequent as the performance reduction intensifies contrast with more frequent network vulnerabilities that result from initial hazard-induced failures and subsequent cascading-induced failure effects. These compound hazard-cascading detrimental effects can have profound implications on infrastructure failure prevention strategies. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

This is relevant for real-world networks that possess a highly heterogeneous distribution of loads, such as the Internet and power grids. We demonstrate that the heterogeneity of these networks makes them particularly vulnerable to attacks in that a large-scale cascade may be triggered by disabling a single key node.

Changing the surface roughness exponent, rough walls having different microstructures are obtained. Different relative roughnesses - defined as the height of the largest surface asperity divided by the mean aperture - are obtained 'pulling apart' the two surfaces that constitute the rough walls of the channel. We calculate the macroscopic variables volume flow rate and pressure difference using microscopic balances. In the low Reynolds number regime the pressure difference and the flow rate are linearly related (the behavior is described by Darcy's law). In this regime, we study the effect of geometry on the permeability. We have found that permeability is independent of the surface roughness exponent H and it is fully determined in terms of the relative roughness and mean aperture of the fracture joint. For larger Reynolds numbers a transition to a regime in which pressure difference and flow rate are not longer linearly related is observed. This transition is observed in a domain of Reynolds numbers for which the behavior in a smooth channel remains linear. We discuss this transition. © 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

In the early 1960s, the coupling between hydraulic and mechanical processes in fractured rock started to receive wide attention. A series of events including dam failures, landslides, and injection- induced earthquakes were believed to result from {HM} interaction. Moreover, the advent of the computer technology in the 1970s made possible the integration of nonlinear processes such as stress-permeability coupling and rock mass failure into coupled {HM} analysis. Coupled {HM} analysis is currently being applied to many geological engineering practices. One key parameter in such analyses is a good estimate of the relationship between stress and permeability. Based on available laboratory and field data, it was found that the permeability of fractured rock masses tends to be most sensitive to stress changes at shallow depth (low stress) and in areas of low in-situ permeability. In highly permeable, fractured rock sections, fluid flow may take place in clusters of connected fractures which are locked open as a result of previous shear dislocation or partial cementation of hard mineral filling. Such locked-open fractures tend to be relatively insensitive to stress and may therefore be conductive at great depths. Because of the great variability of {HM} properties in fractured rock, and the difficulties in using laboratory data for deriving in-situ material properties, the {HM} properties of fractured rock masses are best characterized in situ.},

These data were then used to create a finite-element mesh for the fracture void space, and the Navier-Stokes equations were solved within this domain. Flow experiments were also conducted within the same fracture casts, over a range of flowrates. The simulations confirm the existence of a weak inertia regime for Reynolds numbers in the range of 1-10, in which the non-Darcy pressure drop varies with the cube of the flowrate. Although of theoretical interest, this effect is, however, probably too small to be of engineering interest.

	abstract = {Centrality has revealed crucial for understanding the structural properties of complex relational networks. Centrality is also relevant for various spatial factors affecting human life and behaviors in cities. Here, we present a comprehensive study of centrality distributions over geographic networks of urban streets. Five different measures of centrality, namely degree, closeness, betweenness, straightness and information, are compared over 18 1-square-mile samples of different world cities. Samples are represented by primal geographic graphs, i.e., valued graphs defined by metric rather than topologic distance where intersections are turned into nodes and streets into edges. The spatial behavior of centrality indices over the networks is investigated graphically by means of color-coded maps. The results indicate that a spatial analysis, that we term multiple centrality assessment, grounded not on a single but on a set of different centrality indices, allows an extended comprehension of the city structure, nicely capturing the skeleton of most central routes and subareas that so much impacts on spatial cognition and on collective dynamical behaviors. Statistically, closeness, straightness and betweenness turn out to follow similar functional distribution in all cases, despite the extreme diversity of the considered cities. Conversely, information is found to be exponential in planned cities and to follow a power-law scaling in self-organized cities. Hierarchical clustering analysis, based either on the Gini coefficients of the centrality distributions, or on the correlation between different centrality measures, is able to characterize classes of cities. © 2006 American Institute of Physics.},

	abstract = {Inspired by an old and almost in oblivion urban plan, we report the behavior of the Biham-Middleton-Levine ({BML}) model - a paradigm for studying phase transitions of traffic flow - on a hypothetical city with a perfect honeycomb street network. In contrast with the original {BML} model on a square lattice, the same model on a honeycomb does not show any anisotropy or intermediate states, but a single continuous phase transition between free and totally congested flow, a transition that can be completely characterized by the tools of classical percolation. Although the transition occurs at a lower density than for the conventional {BML}, simple modifications, like randomly stopping the cars with a very small probability or increasing the traffic light periods, drives the model to perform better on honeycomb lattices. As traffic lights and disordered perturbations are inherent in real traffic, these results question the actual role of the square gridlike designs and suggest the honeycomb topology as an interesting alternative for urban planning in real cities.},

	abstract = {Thermo-hydro-mechanical-chemical simulations at the pore scale are conducted to study the hydraulic sealing of siliciclastic rock fractures as contact zones grow driven by pressure dissolution. The evolving fluid-saturated three-dimensional pore space of the fracture results from the elastic contact between self-affine, randomly rough surfaces in response to the effective confining pressure. A diffusion-reaction equation controls pressure solution over contact zones as a function of their emergent geometry and stress variations. Results show that three coupled processes govern the evolution of the fracture’s hydraulic properties: (1) the dissolution-driven convergence of the opposing fracture walls acts to compact the pore space; (2) the growth of contact zones reduces the elastic compression of the pore space; and (3) the growth of contact zones leads to flow channeling and the presence of stagnant zones in the flow field. The dominant early time compaction mechanism is the elastic compression of the fracture void space, but this eventually becomes overshadowed by the irreversible process of pressure dissolution. Growing contact zones isolate void space and cause an increasing disproportion between average and hydraulic aperture. This results in the loss of hydraulic conductivity when the mean aperture is a third of its initial value and the contact ratio approaches the characteristic value of one half. Convergence rates depend on small-wavelength roughness initially and on long-wavelength roughness in the late time. The assumption of a characteristic roughness length scale, therefore, leads to a characteristic time scale with an underestimation of dissolution rates before and an overestimation thereafter.},

	abstract = {The aim of this work is to examine the wellbore pressure behavior in reservoirs with single-phase non-Darcy flow conditions produced at a constant sandface rate. The transient flow period is analyzed by means of results generated with a finite difference model. Analytical expressions of pressure drop and its semilogarithmic slope are presented for the first time. These equations contain the laminar flow solution as a particular case, and they provide means to evaluate the total skin factor. Another use of the analytical solution to the non-Darcy flow problem is to identify the presence of inertial effects by using a diagnostic plot, which consists of graphing the derivative of the pressure data vs. the inverse of the square root of time on a Cartesian paper. In this way, an analyst easily can predict the magnitude of the skin owing to nonlaminar flow under any condition of mechanical skin and rate. Furthermore, better stimulation jobs can be designed if non-Darcy flow conditions during a transient test are properly identified through the methodology presented in this study. The use of the methodology obtained in this work is illustrated with synthetic examples for homogeneous and naturally fractured reservoirs. Also, a field example of an undersaturated reservoir and a dry gas case (taken from the literature) shows the application of this technique. For the case of naturally fractured reservoirs, new insights are provided. Copyright 1996 Society of Petroleum Engineers.},

	abstract = {About half of the world's population now lives in urban areas because of the opportunity for a better quality of life. Many of these urban centers are expanding rapidly, leading to the growth of megacities, which are defined as metropolitan areas with populations exceeding 10 million inhabitants. These concentrations of people and activity are exerting increasing stress on the natural environment, with impacts at urban, regional and global levels. In recent decades, air pollution has become one of the most important problems of megacities. Initially, the main air pollutants of concern were sulfur compounds, which were generated mostly by burning coal. Today, photochemical smog—induced primarily from traffic, but also from industrial activities, power generation, and solvents—has become the main source of concern for air quality, while sulfur is still a major problem in many cities of the developing world. Air pollution has serious impacts on public health, causes urban and regional haze, and has the potential to contribute significantly to climate change. Yet, with appropriate planning, megacities can efficiently address their air quality problems through measures such as application of new emission control technologies and development of mass transit systems. This review is focused on nine urban centers, chosen as case studies to assess air quality from distinct perspectives: from cities in the industrialized nations to cities in the developing world. While each city—its problems, resources, and outlook—is unique, the need for a holistic approach to the complex environmental problems is the same. There is no single strategy in reducing air pollution in megacities; a mix of policy measures will be needed to improve air quality. Experience shows that strong political will coupled with public dialog is essential to effectively implement the regulations required to address air quality problems. © 2004 Air \& Waste Management Association.},

Here we present results of the simulation of cascading failures in power grids, using an alternating current ({AC}) model. We first apply this model to a regular square grid topology. For a random placement of consumers and generators on the grid, the probability to find more than a certain number of unsupplied consumers decays as a power law and obeys a scaling law with respect to system size. Varying the transmitted power threshold above which a transmission line fails does not seem to change the power-law exponent q≈1.6. Furthermore, we study the influence of the placement of generators and consumers on the number of affected consumers and demonstrate that large clusters of generators and consumers are especially vulnerable to cascading failures. As a real-world topology, we consider the German high-voltage transmission grid. Applying the dynamic {AC} model and considering a random placement of consumers, we find that the probability to disconnect more than a certain number of consumers depends strongly on the threshold. For large thresholds the decay is clearly exponential, while for small ones the decay is slow, indicating a power-law decay.},

Here we report simulations of heterogeneous traffic which demonstrate that cooperative, coherent states can arise from competitive interactions between vehicles. As the density of vehicles increases, their interactions cause a transition into a highly correlated state in which all vehicles move with approximately the same speed, analogous to the motion of a solid block. This state is safer because it has a reduced lane-changing rate, and the traffic flow is high and stable. The coherent state disappears when the vehicle density exceeds a critical value.

The parameter most affecting fluid flow through rough joints is the ratio of the mean separation between the surfaces to the root-mean-square surface height. This parameter describes the distance the surface asperities protrude into the fluid and accounts for most of the disagreement with the parallel plate model.-from Author},

	abstract = {Flow through fractures is often idealized as flow between two parallel plates (plane Poiseuille flow). The opening or aperture between parallel plates is unambiguous and its relation to flowrate is well known. However, fractures in rock have uneven walls and a variable aperture. A model for flow in a fracture is proposed wherein the fracture is represented by a set of parallel plate openings with different apertures. The model leads to a modified Poiseuille equation for flow which includes an aperture frequency distribution for the fracture. Any arbitrary aperture distribution can be used; in order to simplify computation and demonstrate the properties of the model a log normal form of distribution is assumed. Even when an analytical form of the distribution is assumed, two parameters, rather than a single value representing ‘aperture size’ are required to determine flowrate. Models of aperture change for a fracture undergoing compression (fracture walls deforming) and extension (fracture walls separating) are developed which constrain the additional parameter and allow calculation of flowrate as a function of mean aperture. The theoretical relationships developed between mean aperture and flowrate can be used to interpret published laboratory data for single fractures. This paper is not subject to U.S. copyright.

	abstract = {A binary medium generation method is presented, which is capable of producing three-dimensional reconstructions of porous solids. The method is based on the midpoint displacement and successive random addition technique, which is, essentially, a graphical reproduction technique for the generation of self-affine media that follow fractional Brownian motion ({FBM}) statistics. Thresholding of the site values at the desired porosity value leads to three-dimensional porous constructions, the correlation degree of which is defined by the preselected value of the Hurst exponent. The correlation length of such single-cell media is comparable to the size of the working cell and, therefore, this approach would be of local use only. To remedy this problem, a method for producing multicell {FBM} media is presented, which is capable of generating media with size considerably larger than the correlation length and, as such, they can be employed to simulate a variety of actual porous solids. The percolation properties of these reconstructions are investigated and the specific surface area is calculated as a function of the porosity, the number of interwoven cells, and the Hurst exponent value. Furthermore, the flow equations are solved numerically within the void space of the three-dimensional {FBM} media and the effects of structure porosity and correlation degree on the permeability are studied. Application of the methodology to a sandstone sample as a case study showed a very good agreement of the numerical predictions for the permeability with actual permeability measurements and with the permeability estimate using a serial sectioning technique. © 2000 The American Physical Society.},

Computed tomography scanning provides a unique view of rock fractures, allowing the measurement of fracture wall-roughness, without destroying the initial rock sample. For this computational fluid dynamics study, we used several different methods to obtain three-dimensional meshes of a computed tomography scanned fracture in Berea sandstone. These volumetric meshes had different wall-roughnesses, which we characterized using the Joint Roughness Coefficient and the fractal dimension of the fracture profiles. We then related these macroscopic roughness parameters to the effective flow through the fractures, as determined from Navier-Stokes numerical models. Thus, we used our fracture meshes to develop relationships between the observed roughness properties of the fracture geometries and flow parameters that are of importance for modeling flow through fractures in field scale models. Fractures with high Joint Roughness Coefficients and fractal dimensions were shown to exhibit tortuous flow paths, be poorly characterized by the mean geometric aperture, and have a fracture transmissivity 35 times smaller than the smoother modeled fracture flows. © 2010.},

A simple model which accounts for the development of channels perpendicular to u→ qualitatively explains these results and predicts a permeability decreasing (increasing) linearly with the variance of the aperture field for flow parallel (perpendicular) to the shear displacement.

There is remarkable similarity among these surfaces. Each surface has a 'red noise' power spectrum over the entire frequency band studied, with the power falling off on average between 2 and 3 orders of magnitude per decade increase in spatial frequency. This implies a strong increase in rms height with surface size, which has little tendency to level off for wavelengths up to 1 meter.

The equation is based on three index parameters; the joint roughness coefficient {JRC}, the joint wall compressive strength {JCS}, and the residual friction angle phi //r. All these index values can be measured in the laboratory. They can also be measured in the field. Index tests and subsequent shear box tests on more than 100 joint samples have demonstrated that phi //r can be estimated to within 1 degree for any one of the eight rock types investigated. The mean value of the peak shear strength angle for the same 100 joints was estimated to be within one-half degree . The exceptionally close prediction of peak strength is made possible by performing self-weight (low stress) sliding tests on blocks with throughgoing joints. The total friction angle at which sliding occurs provides an estimate of the joint roughness coefficient {JRC}. The latter is constant over a range of effective normal stress of at least four orders of magnitude. However, it is found that both {JRC} and {JCS} reduce with increasing joint length. Increasing the length of joint therefore reduces not only the peak shear strength, but also the peak dilation angle and the peak shear stiffness. Refs.},

	abstract = {A closed-form solution is presented for modeling the coupled stress-flow-transport processes along a single fracture embedded in a porous rock matrix. Necessary assumptions were made to simplify the subject into a two-dimensional (2D) problem, considering the changes of fracture aperture and matrix porosity under various stress conditions. The cubic law was assumed to be valid for the fluid flow in the fracture, with an impermeable rock matrix. For transport mechanisms, advective transport along the fracture, longitudinal hydrodynamic dispersion in the flow direction, and the matrix diffusion were considered in three different transport models under constant concentration or constant flux (Danckwerts') inlet boundary conditions. This analytical solution can be used as a constitutive model, or as an example for validation of similar constitutive models, for modeling the coupled hydro-mechanical-chemical ({HMC}) processes in fracture networks of crystalline rocks. The influences of stress/deformation processes on different transport mechanisms in a single fracture under different inlet boundary conditions were studied for the first time. The results show that changes of fracture, as controlled by a combination of normal closure and shear dilatancy, have a significant influence on the solute concentration distribution both along the fracture and in the rock matrix, as well as on the solute residence/breakthrough time, especially when shear-induced dilatancy occurs. Under compressions, the decreasing matrix porosity slightly increases the solute concentration along the fracture and in the rock matrix. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

The reliability of a fracture model is therefore dependent on the soundness of its underlying mechanics.

A series of laboratory tests were performed to examine the fatigue behavior of granite when subjected to cyclic loading under triaxial compression conditions. The tests indicate that the stress corresponding to the transition from volumetric compaction to volumetric dilation may be considered to be the threshold for fatigue failure. A constitutive model was developed based on the test results to describe the fatigue behavior of the rock. A linear elastic model was used to describe the elasticity of the rock, a yield surface was defined using a mean stress-dependent yield surface, an associated flow rule was used to specify the flow direction, and a kinematic hardening model was used to specify the hardening behavior of the rock. A user subroutine for the model was coded with a finite element mesh to assess the stability and containment performance of the facility when subjected to cyclic loading due to storage and extraction of crude oil. Synchronous and asynchronous storage and extraction of crude oil in the facility were simulated. The simulations indicate that both the crown settlement and plastic deformation in the synchronous case were greater than those in the asynchronous case, whereas the volume of groundwater inflow into the caverns in the synchronous case was less than that in the asynchronous case. However, in both the synchronous and asynchronous cases, the stability and containment properties of the caverns remained adequate during the operation phase.},

Both laminar and turbulent flow simulations were performed for a wide range of flow rates. Also, a new non-linear fluid flow formulation was developed on the basis of some geometrical and kinematical assumptions for fracture and fluid flow, respectively. Based on comparison between simulation results and developed formulation, a new geometrical model has been proposed for non-linear fluid flow through rough fractures, which suggests a polynomial expression, like Forchheimer law, to describe the dependence of pressure drop on flow rate. Finally, this model has been evaluated with experimental results of a fracture with different geometries. The results show that the predicted pressure drop for turbulent flow simulation was roughly 3-17\% more than those for laminar one at the Reynolds number of 4.5-89.5, respectively. Moreover, a good accuracy was found between the proposed model and turbulent flow simulation results.

The electric and hydraulic apertures are nearly the same when the surfaces are widely separated. However, de is always smaller than dh, with the difference increasing as the fracture closes.

	abstract = {Fluid flow in single fractures with non-uniform apertures is an important research subject in many disciplines. The abruptly changing aperture is a special case of such non-uniformity. This paper simulates water flow in a single fracture with abruptly changing aperture ({SF}-{ACA}) using the Lattice Boltzmann Method ({LBM}) and the Finite Volume Method ({FVM}). The flow occurs with the Reynolds number (Re) ranging from 5 to 900 and a ratio of aperture change (E) of 3 (E=D/d, where D and d are the larger and smaller apertures, respectively). For Re values between 5 and 100, both {LBM} and {FVM} can successfully simulate the eddy development in the expansion regime of an {SF}-{ACA}. Flow with high Re values (up to 900) is simulated by {FVM}, which appears to be numerically more stable than {LBM} for high-Re flow problems studied here. The flow symmetry in the expansion regime breaks at the Re value between 400 and 500. Our simulation result shows a linear relationship between l 1/d and Re at low Re (5-100) or higher Re (110-900) values, where defined as the length from the location of abrupt expansion to the right edge of the first eddy along the flow direction. If considering the simulation results for the entire simulated range of Re (5-900), the l 1/d-Re relationship is better described by a non-linear logarithmical function. The l 1/d approaches an asymptotic constant at large Re. © 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Quantitative roughness measurements on different fractured granite samples show that the surfaces have a self-affine geometry from which the dependence of the mean aperture on the relative displacement of fracture surfaces kept in contact can be predicted. Variations of the hydraulic and electrical conductances of the joint are measured as functions of its mean aperture. A simple parallel plane model accounts for the global trend of the measurements, but significant deviations are observed when a relative lateral displacement of the surfaces is introduced. A theoretical analysis of their origin shows that they are due both to the randomness of the aperture field and to a nonzero local slope of the surface near the injection hole; the corresponding conductivity fluctuation amplitudes have power law and linear variations with the lateral displacement, and are enhanced by the radial injection geometry.

Local aspects of the flow fields, such as maximum velocity and pressure fluctuations, are studied, and the non-Newtonian fluids are compared to the (previously studied) Newtonian case. We find a scaling relation between permeability and mean aperture in the low Reynolds number regime, generalizing an earlier result for Newtonian fluids. As the Reynolds number increases, we observe the same sequence of transitions to nonlinearity found in intergranular porous media.

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent {MM}- {GBSA} calculations. Using the best {RMSD} among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate ({RMSD} ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide {SP} settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta {FlexPepDock} method (63\% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Thermal and hydraulic properties are characterized via the definition of hydraulic and thermal apertures both at microscopic and macroscopic scales and obtained by comparing the fluxes to the ones of flat fractures. Statistics over a large number of fracture configurations provide an estimate of the average behavior and its variability. We show that the long-range correlations of the fracture roughness induces strong channeling effects that significantly influence the hydraulic and thermal properties. An important parameter is the aspect ratio (length over width) of the fracture: we show, for example, that a downstream elongated rough fracture is more likely to inhibit the hydraulic flow and subsequently to enhance the thermal exchange. Fracture roughness might, in the opposite configuration, favor strong channeling which inhibits heating of the fluid. The thermal behavior is in general shown to be mainly dependent on the hydraulic one, which is expressed through a simple law. © 2010 The American Physical Society.},

	abstract = {Fluid flow in a rock fracture bounded by two irregular surfaces is complex even trader a laminar flow regime. The major factor causing deviation of predicted fracture flow behavior from the ideal parallel plate theory is the nature of nonparallel and nonsmooth geometry of fracture surfaces. Important questions on the validity of the cubic law and the Reynolds equation for complicated fracture geometries have been studied by many researchers. The general conclusion from these efforts is that the cubic law is valid provided that an appropriate average aperture can be defined. Many average apertures have been proposed, and for some cases, some work better than others. Nonetheless, to date, these efforts have not converged to form a unified definition on the fracture aperture needed in the cubic law, which stimulates the current effort to develop a general governing equation for fracture flow from a fundamental consideration. In this study, a governing equation stemming from the principle of mass conservation and the assumption that the cubic law holds locally is derived for incompressible laminar fluid flow in irregular fractures under steady state conditions. The equation is formulated in both local and global coordinates and explicitly incorporates two vectorial variables of fracture geometry: true aperture and tortuosity. Under the assumption of small variations in both tortuosity and aperture, the governing equation can be reduced to the Reynolds equation. Two examples are provided to show the importance and generality of the new governing equation in both local and global coordinate systems. In a simple fracture with two nonsmooth and nonparallel surfaces, the error in permeability estimation can be induced using the Reynolds equation with the apparent aperture and can reach 10\% for a 25°inclination between the fracture surfaces. In a fracture with sinusoidal surfaces, the traditional method can cause significant errors in both permeability and pressure calculation.},

The tailing is more persistent at higher Reynolds numbers (Re), with the exponents of the power law {RTDs} related to Re via a power function, and becomes asymptotic at higher Re. The late-time portion ofthe {RTD} changes with flow direction and is also sensitive to whether the flow is represented by the {NSE} or the {SE}.

	abstract = {The flow of a single-phase fluid through a rough-walled rock fracture is discussed within the context of fluid mechanics. The derivation of the 'cubic law' is given as the solution to the Navier-Stokes equations for flow between smooth, parallel plates - the only fracture geometry that is amenable to exact treatment. The various geometric and kinematic conditions that are necessary in order for the Navier-Stokes equations to be replaced by the more tractable lubrication or Hele-Shaw equations are studied and quantified. In general, this requires a sufficiently low flow rate, and some restrictions on the spatial rate of change of the aperture profile. Various analytical and numerical results are reviewed pertaining to the problem of relating the effective hydraulic aperture to the statistics of the aperture distribution. These studies all lead to the conclusion that the effective hydraulic aperture is less than the mean aperture, by a factor that depends on the ratio of the mean value of the aperture to its standard deviation. The tortuosity effect caused by regions where the rock walls are in contact with each other is studied using the Hele-Shaw equations, leading to a simple correction factor that depends on the area fraction occupied by the contact regions. Finally, the predicted hydraulic apertures are compared to measured values for eight data sets from the literature for which aperture and conductivity data were available on the same fracture. It is found that reasonably accurate predictions of hydraulic conductivity can be made based solely on the first two moments of the aperture distribution function, and the proportion of contact area. © 1996 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

Findings from this investigation make it possible to estimate the stress-strain and fluid flow behavior when the roughness characteristics fo the fracture are known and conversely to estimate the fracture roughness from an examination of the hydraulic and mechanical data. Results showed that both the mechanical and hydraulic properties of the fracture are controlled by the large-scale roughness of the joint surface.

First, the size effect on the standard deviation of the initial aperture was analyzed for fractures with and without shearing. Next, by taking aperture data at constant intervals to establish a flow area, water flow was simulated for fractures during both normal closure and closure after shearing, by solving Reynolds equation to determine the hydraulic aperture. When the fracture is closed without shearing and has the same mean aperture, the effect of the fracture size on the hydraulic aperture disappears if the fracture is larger than about 0.2 m, since beyond this size the standard deviation of the initial aperture is almost independent of the fracture size. When the fracture is closed after shearing, the hydraulic conductivity shows remarkable anisotropy, which becomes more significant with both shear displacement and closure. However, the relation between the hydraulic aperture normalized by the mean aperture and the mean aperture normalized by the standard deviation of the initial aperture is almost independent of both the fracture size and shear displacement when the shear displacement is less than about 3.1\% of the fracture size, at which point the standard deviation of the initial aperture of the sheared fracture is almost independent of the fracture size. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Flow of non-Newtonian fluids in rough-walled rock fractures is common in many technological processes in oil and gas industry. A numerical study of power-law fluid flow in rough-walled fractures is carried out under the assumptions of the lubrication theory approximation. It is shown that, in a self-affine fracture, varying the exponent of the power-law fluid may lead to a redirection of flow compared to a Newtonian fluid flow field. This effect is observed even though the fracture landscape is isotropic, i.e. no preferential flow paths have been created in the model by e.g. relative displacement of the fracture faces. In another fracture, one that contains an obstacle represented by a spot of zero aperture, the spread of the flow around the obstacle is again controlled by the power exponent of the fluid. The fluid being more shear-thinning leads to a channelization of the flow in such a fracture. "Channelization" here refers to the fluid velocity component in the direction of the applied pressure gradient becoming larger as compared to the velocity component in the direction normal to the overall flow direction as the fluid becomes more shear-thinning. A channelization is also observed in a fracture containing a local zone of an elevated aperture. The effects of rheology on the spread and redirection of flow in a fracture of variable aperture are crucial for optimization of transport and placement of particles or tracers in natural and man-made fractures. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Using Radok's principle of functional equations, it is shown analytically that this problem is closely related to the recently investigated problem of contact of self-affine surfaces with an elastic half space. We show that the penetration velocity occurs to be a power function of the applied force and time, the corresponding exponents depending only on the Hurst exponent. For comparison, the same problem is solved using the method of reduction of dimensionality.

	abstract = {Experiments were performed to study the effect of fracture surface roughness on fluid distribution during miscible displacement. The transparent replicas of single fractures obtained from seven different rocks were prepared and the surface roughness of each sample was described by fractal dimensions using the variogram, power spectral, and triangular prism ({TP}) techniques. Then, the effect of flow rate and viscosity on the geometry of the displacement front during miscible radial injection was investigated experimentally. The fractal dimensions of the fronts were obtained using box counting fractal analysis at different time lapses. The fractal values of invasion front varied from lithology to lithology, due to different surface roughnesses controlled by the lithology of the rocks. Although fluctuations of fractal values were observed during the growth of the front, fractal dimensions typically yielded an increasing trend. Fractal dimension became more stable with increasing flow rate and developed modestly with increasing viscosity. Finally, relationships between the fractal dimensions of displacement fronts and fracture surfaces were quantitatively analyzed and correlated in order to improve the prediction of fluid distribution within a single fracture during miscible displacement. Overall, correlations were observed between the surface characteristics and front fractal dimension values with some exceptions. In summary, to determine the probable distribution of miscible fluid and development of the front, all parameters except power spectral density ({PSD}) fractal dimension can be applied in the case of high viscosity ratios. In the case of low injection rates, {TP} could be applicable. No fractal behavior was present at extreme injection and low viscosity ratios, thus no correlation can be determined for the miscible displacement.},

If the coupling effects are considered, the changes of boundary heads have less influence on the inner head of rock mass, and the strong permeability of main fractures appears. If the coupling effects are not considered, the fractures distribution affects the inner head more greatly. When the upstream water head declines, the inner head of dam foundation slightly declines and the hydraulic gradient distribution becomes smoother. A bigger upstream water level declining velocity has a stronger lag effect, meanwhile the values of stress components change more greatly. Therefore the upstream water level declining velocity directly affects the stability of rock mass in dam foundation and we should take into account the above factors to make sure the safety of the dam during reservoir level fluctuation period. © Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2011.},

This study conducted flow tests on crossed fracture models with a single intersection and performed numerical simulations on fluid flow through {DFNs} of various geometric characteristics. The roles of aperture, surface roughness, and number of intersections of fractures on the variation of the critical hydraulic gradient (Jc) for the onset of nonlinear flow through {DFNs} were systematically investigated. The results showed that the relationship between hydraulic gradient (J) and flow rate can be well quantified by Forchheimer's law; when J drops below Jc, it reduces to the widely used cubic law, by diminishing the nonlinear term. Larger apertures, rougher fracture surfaces, and a greater number of intersections in a {DFN} would result in the onset of nonlinear flow at a lower Jc. Mathematical expressions of Jc and the coefficients involved in Forchheimer's law were developed based on multi-variable regressions of simulation results, which can help to choose proper governing equations when solving problems associated with fluid flow in fracture networks.},

	abstract = {The validity of the cubic law for laminar flow of fluids through open fractures consisting of parallel planar plates has been established by others over a wide range of conditions with apertures ranging down to a minimum of 0.2 µm. The law may be given in simplified form by Q/Δh = C(2b)3, where Q is the flow rate, Δh is the difference in hydraulic head, C is a constant that depends on the flow geometry and fluid properties, and 2b is the fracture aperture. The validity of this law for flow in a closed fracture where the surfaces are in contact and the aperture is being decreased under stress has been investigated at room temperature by using homogeneous samples of granite, basalt, and marble. Tension fractures were artificially induced, and the laboratory setup used radial as well as straight flow geometries. Apertures ranged from 250 down to 4µm, which was the minimum size that could be attained under a normal stress of 20 {MPa}. The cubic law was found to be valid whether the fracture surfaces were held open or were being closed under stress, and the results are not dependent on rock type. Permeability was uniquely defined by fracture aperture and was independent of the stress history used in these investigations. The effects of deviations from the ideal parallel plate concept only cause an apparent reduction in flow and may be incorporated into the cubic law by replacing C by C/ƒ. The factor ƒ varied from 1.04 to 1.65 in these investigations. The model of a fracture that is being closed under normal stress is visualized as being controlled by the strength of the asperities that are in contact. These contact areas are able to withstand significant stresses while maintaining space for fluids to continue to flow as the fracture aperture decreases. The controlling factor is the magnitude of the aperture, and since flow depends on (2b)3, a slight change in aperture evidently can easily dominate any other change in the geometry of the flow field. Thus one does not see any noticeable shift in the correlations of our experimental results in passing from a condition where the fracture surfaces were held open to one where the surfaces were being closed under stress.

	abstract = {We introduce a model that allows for the prediction of the permeability of self-affine rough channels (one-dimensional fracture) and two-dimensional fractures over a wide range of apertures. In the lubrication approximation, the permeability shows three different scaling regimes. For fractures with a large mean aperture or an aperture small enough to the permeability being close to disappearing, the permeability scales as the cube of the aperture when the zero level of the aperture is set to coincide with the disappearance of the permeability. Between these two regimes, there is a third regime where the scaling is due to the self-affine roughness. For rough channels, the exponent is found to be 3-1/H, where H is the Hurst exponent. For two-dimensional fractures, it is necessary to introduce an equivalent aperture bc to make the scaling regime apparent. bc is defined as the hydraulic aperture of the most restrictive barrier crossing the fracture normal to the flow direction. This regime is characterized by an exponent higher than that for the one-dimensional case: it is 2.25 for H=0.8 and 2.16 for H=0.3. © 2010 The American Physical Society.},

To accurately characterize the diversity of pore structure, hydraulic flow units ({HFU}) based on the modified flow zone indicator data are subdivided, and experiments of mercury injection and routine core analysis are conducted for 601 sandstone samples in this study. Five samples selected from different {HFU} (porosity is approximately equal, however permeability varies widely) are chosen to conduct micro-computerized tomography test. Then, fractal and multifractal methods are used to characterize complex pore space of chosen samples based on the number-area model, radius-volume model and number-radius model respectively, in which the effect of image scale on the fractal dimension is investigated. Each {HFU} has similar box dimension and generalized fractal dimension, but has significant difference in multifractal spectrum. Specially, the different values of singularity exponent in the multifractal spectrum have a good relationship with the experimentally measured permeability. There are clear inflections points on the fractal curves from mercury injection curve. Based on the value of maximum pore throat radius, only one segment (located in the middle) can be used to calculate the fractal dimension. Fractal dimension obtained by pore network model does not satisfy the traditional relationship.

Active transport exists when large enough particle concentration is present in the fluid and when the mass of particles is large enough for inertia effects to be non negligible. In such situations, particles trajectories differ from fluid flow lines, the reaction forces of particles on the fluid are important and modify the Navier-Stokes equation, collisions between solid particles are non negligible and are affected by the turbulent fluctuations of the fluid velocity field. As a consequence the Navier-Stokes turbulent hierarchy is coupled to an inelastic Boltzmann-like kinetic equation for the phase-space one particle distribution of the solid particles. Effects of fluid velocity field fluctuations on binary collisions of particles are discussed and shown to modify the collision term of the kinetic equation. Moreover, we show that the Lagrangian equations of motion for the particles in the fluid are fractional differential equations. This is due to the non-Markovian character of the hydrodynamical forces acting on particles dispersed in unsteady flows.},

It is shown that a line of tracer is progressively wrinkled into a self-affine curve with an exponent equal to that of the crack surface. This leads to a global dispersion coefficient which depends on the distance from the tracer inlet, but which is still proportional to the mean advection velocity. Besides, the tracer front is subjected to a local dispersion (as could be revealed by point measurements or echo experiments) very different from the global one.

A finite volume formulation of the {LCL} that incorporates geometric corrections for fracture undulation is presented. Simulations of fluid flow through planar fractures with sinusoidal variation in aperture were compared to published results. The rough-walled fracture simulations demonstrated that the total flow rates predicted by the corrected {LCL} were within 10\% of those predicted by the Stokes equations for all the fractures examined in this work. Differences between the {NS} and Stokes simulations clearly demonstrated that inertial forces can significantly influence the internal flow field within a fracture and the total flow rate across a fracture. By limiting the total flow rate differences between the {NS} and Stokes simulations, constraints for three kinematic parameters were determined.

We present some recent models that introduce the effects of deviations from homogeneous linear elasticity theory on the morphology of fracture surfaces, successfully reproducing the multiscaling phenomenology at least in 1+1 dimensions. For surfaces in 2+1 dimensions we introduce novel methods of analysis based on projecting the data on the irreducible representations of the {SO}(2) symmetry group.

	abstract = {The effect of shear displacement inclined relative to macroscopic water flow on the hydraulic conductivity of a rock fracture was estimated, using synthetic fractures that reproduce a tensile fracture in granite. The results showed that the hydraulic aperture normalized by the mean aperture increased with the angle between the directions of shear displacement and macroscopic water flow, according to a sinusoidal function of twice the angle. Formulae were established to estimate the hydraulic aperture of the fracture as a function of the mean aperture, the standard deviation of the initial aperture, the shear displacement, and the angle between the shear displacement and macroscopic water flow, based on results obtained in both this work and previous work, but neglecting scale effects. By assuming the mechanical properties of the fracture based on experimental results for granite, but neglecting scale effects, the hydraulic conductivity of the fracture with an arbitrary direction under a given state of stress (σ1=29 {MPa}, σ2=25 {MPa} and σ3=13.5 {MPa}) was estimated for macroscopic water flow in the directions of both σ1 and σ2. When the contour map of the transmissivity of the fracture is plotted on a stereonet of the normal direction of the fracture in the principal axes of stress, there is a ridge (line of the local maximum) of transmissivity in the circumferential direction, and the inclination angle of the ridge from the σ3-axis decreases with shear displacement, since shear dilation increases with both a decrease in normal stress and an increase in shear displacement. Furthermore, for the condition of stress given in this study, the transmissivity for macroscopic water flow in the direction of σ1 is maximum for a fracture with a normal direction within the σ2-σ3 plane, while that in the direction of σ2 is maximum for a fracture with a normal direction within the σ1-σ3 plane. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

A wavelet analysis technique was developed to define a mathematical criterion for decomposing the original wall surface roughness profiles of a fracture into a high-frequency (secondary roughness) profile and a low-frequency (primary roughness) profile, in order to examine their impacts on fluid flow, by solving the Navier-Stokes equations ({NSE}) without linearization, using a self-developed 2D finite volume method ({FVM}) code. The results indicate that the high-frequency secondary roughness is the main cause for dynamic evolution of Eddy flow regions in the fracture flow field, besides the Reynolds number (Re). In the original fracture model with the high-frequency secondary roughness, our results show that fluid flow fields are not only generally non-linear, but also with non-stop generation and motions of eddies in the boundary layer regions of rough fractures when the Re=1000 in this study, which will affect the solute transport processes in fractured rock masses. The complete {NSE} were solved without removing acceleration and inertial terms, so that the impacts of surface roughness on the nonlinear and dynamic flow behavior of rock fractures were calculated and visualized more accurately, which is important for modeling mass and energy transport processes in fractures and fractured rock masses.},

We also searched, without success, for phenomena due to phase coherence of {CF}. The relative ease with which the various magnetoresistance effects are seen in {CF} is discussed, in part with the aid of semiclassical simulations. It is discovered that inhomogeneities of carrier density cause the magnetoresistance anomalies to be smeared out, largely as a result of spatial variations in the effective magnetic field experienced by the {CF}.

However, computational approaches to infer elements of the signaling network strictly from the quantitative aspects of proteomics data are not well established. We considered a method using the principle of maximum entropy to infer a network of interacting phosphotyrosine sites from pairwise correlations in a mass spectrometry data set and derive a phosphorylation-dependent interaction network solely from quantitative proteomics data. We first investigated the applicability of this approach by using a simulation of a model biochemical signaling network whose dynamics are governed by a large set of coupled differential equations. We found that in a simulated signaling system, the method detects interactions with significant accuracy. We then analyzed a growth factor mediated signaling network in a human mammary epithelial cell line that we inferred from mass spectrometry data and observe a biologically interpretable, small-world structure of signaling nodes, as well as a catalog of predictions regarding the interactions among previously uncharacterized phosphotyrosine sites. For example, the calculation places a recently identified tumor suppressor pathway through {ARHGEF}7 and Scribble, in the context of growth factor signaling. Our findings suggest that maximum entropy derived network models are an important tool for interpreting quantitative proteomics data.},

	abstract = {Recent advances in experimental techniques have allowed the simultaneous recordings of populations of hundreds of neurons, fostering a debate about the nature of the collective structure of population neural activity. Much of this debate has focused on the empirical findings of a phase transition in the parameter space of maximum entropy models describing the measured neural probability distributions, interpreting this phase transition to indicate a critical tuning of the neural code. Here, we instead focus on the possibility that this is a first-order phase transition which provides evidence that the real neural population is in a ‘structured’, collective state. We show that this collective state is robust to changes in stimulus ensemble and adaptive state. We find that the pattern of pairwise correlations between neurons has a strength that is well within the strongly correlated regime and does not require fine tuning, suggesting that this state is generic for populations of 100+ neurons. We find a clear correspondence between the emergence of a phase transition, and the emergence of attractor-like structure in the inferred energy landscape. A collective state in the neural population, in which neural activity patterns naturally form clusters, provides a consistent interpretation for our results.},

We revisit these claims with a completely different and independent approach, employing a maximum entropy model to test whether signatures of criticality appear in urethane-anesthetized rats. To account for the spontaneous variation of cortical states, we parse the time series and perform the maximum entropy analysis as a function of the variability of the population spiking activity. To compare data sets with different numbers of neurons, we define a normalized distance to criticality that takes into account the peak and width of the specific heat curve. We found a universal collapse of the normalized distance to criticality dependence on the cortical state, on an animal by animal basis. This indicates a universal dynamics and a critical point at an intermediate value of spiking variability.},

However, evidence for criticality has relied on the definition of arbitrary order parameters, or on models that do not address the dynamical nature of network activity. Here we introduce a novel approach to assess criticality that overcomes these limitations, while encompassing and generalizing previous criteria. We find a simple model to describe the global activity of large populations of ganglion cells in the rat retina, and show that their statistics are poised near a critical point. Taking into account the temporal dynamics of the activity greatly enhances the evidence for criticality, revealing it where previous methods would not.

	abstract = {Current understanding of many neural circuits is limited by our ability to explore the vast number of potential interactions between different cells. We present a new approach that dramatically reduces the complexity of this problem. Large-scale multi-electrode recordings were used to measure electrical activity in nearly complete, regularly spaced mosaics of several hundred {ON} and {OFF} parasol retinal ganglion cells in macaque monkey retina. Parasol cells exhibited substantial pairwise correlations, as has been observed in other species, indicating functional connectivity. However, pairwise measurements alone are insufficient to determine the prevalence of multi-neuron firing patterns, which would be predicted from widely diverging common inputs and have been hypothesized to convey distinct visual messages to the brain. The number of possible multi-neuron firing patterns is far too large to study exhaustively, but this problem may be circumvented if two simple rules of connectivity can be established: (1) multi-cell firing patterns arise from multiple pairwise interactions, and (2) interactions are limited to adjacent cells in the mosaic. Using maximum entropy methods from statistical mechanics, we show that pairwise and adjacent interactions accurately accounted for the structure and prevalence of multi-neuron firing patterns, explaining ∼98\% of the departures from statistical independence in parasol cells and ∼99\% of the departures that were reproducible in repeated measurements. This approach provides a way to define limits on the complexity of network interactions and thus may be relevant for probing the function of many neural circuits.

We apply those algorithms to reanalyze multielectrode recordings in the salamander retina in darkness and under random visual stimulus. We find strong positive couplings between nearby ganglion cells common to both stimuli, whereas long-range couplings appear under random stimulus only. The uncertainty on the inferred couplings due to limitations in the recordings (duration, small area covered on the retina) is discussed. Our methods will allow realtime evaluation of couplings for large assemblies of neurons.},

When firms possess heterogeneous productivity, countries differ in relative factor abundance, and industries vary in factor intensity, falling trade costs induce reallocations of resources both within and across industries and countries. These reallocations generate substantial job turnover in all sectors, spur relatively more creative destruction in comparative advantage industries than in comparative disadvantage industries, and magnify ex ante comparative advantage to create additional welfare gains from trade. The improvements in aggregate productivity as countries liberalize dampen and can even reverse the real-wage losses of scarce factors. © 2007 The Review of Economic Studies Limited.},

One of the most relevant features of graphs representing real systems is community structure, or clustering, i.e. the organization of vertices in clusters, with many edges joining vertices of the same cluster and comparatively few edges joining vertices of different clusters. Such clusters, or communities, can be considered as fairly independent compartments of a graph, playing a similar role like, e.g., the tissues or the organs in the human body. Detecting communities is of great importance in sociology, biology and computer science, disciplines where systems are often represented as graphs. This problem is very hard and not yet satisfactorily solved, despite the huge effort of a large interdisciplinary community of scientists working on it over the past few years. We will attempt a thorough exposition of the topic, from the definition of the main elements of the problem, to the presentation of most methods developed, with a special focus on techniques designed by statistical physicists, from the discussion of crucial issues like the significance of clustering and how methods should be tested and compared against each other, to the description of applications to real networks. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

With a novel search algorithm, we extract and illustrate the rich multilevel organization of several large social and biological networks. For example, from the global air traffic network we uncover countries and continents, and from the pattern of scientific communication we reveal more than 100 scientific fields organized in four major disciplines: life sciences, physical sciences, ecology and earth sciences, and social sciences.

	abstract = {Networked structures arise in a wide array of different contexts such as technological and transportation infrastructures, social phenomena, and biological systems. These highly interconnected systems have recently been the focus of a great deal of attention that has uncovered and characterized their topological complexity. Along with a complex topological structure, real networks display a large heterogeneity in the capacity and intensity of the connections. These features, however, have mainly not been considered in past studies where links are usually represented as binary states, i.e., either present or absent. Here, we study the scientific collaboration network and the world-wide air-transportation network, which are representative examples of social and large infrastructure systems, respectively. In both cases it is possible to assign to each edge of the graph a weight proportional to the intensity or capacity of the connections among the various elements of the network. We define appropriate metrics combining weighted and topological observables that enable us to characterize the complex statistical properties and heterogeneity of the actual strength of edges and vertices. This information allows us to investigate the correlations among weighted quantities and the underlying topological structure of the network. These results provide a better description of the hierarchies and organizational principles at the basis of the architecture of weighted networks.},

Recent studies of networks have, by and large, steered clear of such weighted networks, which are often perceived as being harder to analyze than their unweighted counterparts. Here we point out that weighted networks can in many cases be analyzed using a simple mapping from a weighted network to an unweighted multigraph, allowing us to apply standard techniques for unweighted graphs to weighted ones as well. We give a number of examples of the method, including an algorithm for detecting community structure in weighted networks and a simple proof of the maximum-flow–minimum-cut theorem. © 2004 The American Physical Society.},

The solution is found in time that is (i) close to the shortest possible and (ii) superior to any deterministic verification strategy. A provably fastest model verification strategy is designed for the (theoretical) situation when the contamination of data by outliers is known. In this case, the algorithm is the fastest possible (on average) of all randomized {RANSAC} algorithms guaranteeing a confidence in the solution. The derivation of the optimality property is based on Wald's theory of sequential decision making, in particular a modified sequential probability ratio test ({SPRT}). Next, the R-{RANSAC} with {SPRT} algorithm is introduced. The algorithm removes the requirement for a priori knowledge of the fraction of outliers and estimates the quantity online. We show experimentally that on standard test data the method has performance close to the theoretically optimal and is 2 to 10 times faster than standard {RANSAC} and is up to 4 times faster than previously published methods. © 2008 {IEEE}.},

We show that the heuristic is capable of delivering results which are indistinguishable from the more exact and numerically expensive {MCMC} method in many artificial and empirical networks, despite being much faster.

A distinction is made between, on the one hand, the learning processes taking place among actors embedded in a community by just being there dubbed buzz and, on the other, the knowledge attained by investing in building channels of communication called pipelines to selected providers located outside the local milieu. It is argued that the co-existence of high levels of buzz and many pipelines may provide firms located in outward-looking and lively clusters with a string of particular advantages not available to outsiders.

Researchers have concentrated particularly on a few properties that seem to be common to many networks: the small-world property, power-law degree distributions, and network transitivity. In this article, we highlight another property that is found in many networks, the property of community structure, in which network nodes are joined together in tightly knit groups, between which there are only looser connections. We propose a method for detecting such communities, built around the idea of using centrality indices to find community boundaries. We test our method on computer-generated and real-world graphs whose community structure is already known and find that the method detects this known structure with high sensitivity and reliability. We also apply the method to two networks whose community structure is not well known—a collaboration network and a food web—and find that it detects significant and informative community divisions in both cases.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.10955},
	abstract = {A recent paper by Hausmann and collaborators (1) reaches the important conclusion that Complexity-weighted diversification is the essential element to predict country growth. We like this result because Complexity-weighted diversification is precisely the first equation of the Fitness algorithm that we introduced in 2012 (2,3). However, contrary to what is claimed in (1), it is incorrect to say that diversification is contained also in the {ECI} algorithm (4). We discuss the origin of this misunderstanding and show that the {ECI} algorithm contains exactly zero diversification. This is actually one of the reasons for the poor performances of {ECI} which leads to completely unrealistic results, as for instance, the derivation that Qatar or Saudi Arabia are industrially more competitive than China (5,6). Another important element of our new approach is the representation of the economic dynamics of countries as trajectories in the {GDPpc}-Fitness space (7-10). In some way also this has been rediscovered by Hausmann and collaborators and renamed as "Stream plots", but, given their weaker metrics and methods, they propose it to use it only for a qualitative insight, while ours led to quantitative and successful forecasting. The Fitness approach has paved the way to a robust and testable framework for Economic Complexity resulting in a highly competitive scheme for growth forecasting (7-10). According to a recent report by Bloomberg (9): The new Fitness method, "systematically outperforms standard methods, despite requiring much less data".},

Traditionally, economic growth is modelled with a few aggregate quantities derived from simplified theoretical models. {PriSDA}, by contrast, identifies important quantities. Applied to 55 years of data on countries’ exports, {PriSDA} finds that what most distinguishes countries’ export baskets is their diversity, with extra weight assigned to more sophisticated products. The weights are consistent with previous measures of product complexity. The second dimension of variation is proficiency in machinery relative to agriculture. {PriSDA} then infers the dynamics of these two quantities and of {\textless}italic{\textgreater}per capita{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} income.

Here we develop a new statistical approach based on coupled non-linear maps, whose fixed point defines a new metrics for the country Fitness and product Complexity. We show that a non-linear iteration is necessary to bound the complexity of products by the fitness of the less competitive countries exporting them.

Here we develop a view of economic growth and development that gives a central role to the complexity of a country's economy by interpreting trade data as a bipartite network in which countries are connected to the products they export, and show that it is possible to quantify the complexity of a country's economy by characterizing the structure of this network. Furthermore, we show that the measures of complexity we derive are correlated with a country's level of income, and that deviations from this relationship are predictive of future growth. This suggests that countries tend to converge to the level of income dictated by the complexity of their productive structures, indicating that development efforts should focus on generating the conditions that would allow complexity to emerge to generate sustained growth and prosperity.},

Most countries can reach the core only by traversing empirically infrequent distances, which may help explain why poor countries have trouble developing more competitive exports and fail to converge to the income levels of rich countries.},

Thus, market baskets analysis to obtain useful information and find interesting pattern of buying behavior could be a daunting task. Based on the maximum entropy principle, we build a probabilistic model that explains the probability of occurrence of market baskets which is equivalent to Ising models. This type of model allows us to understand and to explore the functional interactions among products that make up the market offer. Additionally, the parameters of the model inferred using Boltzmann learning, allow us to suggest that the buying behavior is very similar to the spin-glass physical system. Moreover, we show that the resulting parameters of the model could be useful to describe the hierarchical structure of the system which leads to interesting information about the different market baskets.},

Successful analysis thus depends on simplifying hypotheses, but experiments on many systems hint that complicated, higher-order interactions among large groups of elements have an important role. Here we show, in the vertebrate retina, that weak correlations between pairs of neurons coexist with strongly collective behaviour in the responses of ten or more neurons. We find that this collective behaviour is described quantitatively by models that capture the observed pairwise correlations but assume no higher-order interactions. These maximum entropy models are equivalent to Ising models, and predict that larger networks are completely dominated by correlation effects. This suggests that the neural code has associative or error-correcting properties, and we provide preliminary evidence for such behaviour. As a first test for the generality of these ideas, we show that similar results are obtained from networks of cultured cortical neurons.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Reading is a complex cognitive process that involves primary oculomotor function and high-level activities like attention focus and language processing. When we read, our eyes move by primary physiological functions while responding to language-processing demands. In fact, the eyes perform discontinuous twofold movements, namely, successive long jumps (saccades) interposed by small steps (fixations) in which the gaze “scans” confined locations. It is only through the fixations that information is effectively captured for brain processing. Since individuals can express similar as well as entirely different opinions about a given text, it is therefore expected that the form, content and style of a text could induce different eye-movement patterns among people. A question that naturally arises is whether these individuals’ behaviours are correlated, so that eye-tracking while reading can be used as a proxy for text subjective properties. Here we perform a set of eye-tracking experiments with a group of individuals reading different types of texts, including children stories, random word generated texts and excerpts from literature work. In parallel, an extensive Internet survey was conducted for categorizing these texts in terms of their complexity and coherence, considering a large number of individuals selected according to different ages, gender and levels of education. The computational analysis of the fixation maps obtained from the gaze trajectories of the subjects for a given text reveals that the average “magnetization” of the fixation configurations correlates strongly with their complexity observed in the survey. Moreover, we perform a thermodynamic analysis using the Maximum-Entropy Model and find that coherent texts were closer to their corresponding “critical points” than non-coherent ones, as computed from the Pairwise Maximum-Entropy method, suggesting that different texts may induce distinct cohesive reading activities.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

In this way, the movement of the eyes certainly represents the most explicit and closest connection we can get to the inner mechanisms governing this cognitive activity. Here we show that the process of eye movement during visual search, consisting of sequences of fixations intercalated by saccades, exhibits distinctive persistent behaviors. Initially, by focusing on saccadic directions and intersaccadic angles, we disclose that the probability distributions of these measures show a clear preference of participants towards a reading-like mechanism (geometrical persistence), whose features and potential advantages for searching/foraging are discussed. We then perform a Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis ({MF}-{DFA}) over the time series of jump magnitudes in the eye trajectory and find that it exhibits a typical multifractal behavior arising from the sequential combination of saccades and fixations. By inspecting the time series composed of only fixational movements, our results reveal instead a monofractal behavior with a Hurst exponent H ≈ 0.7, which indicates the presence of long-range power-law positive correlations (statistical persistence). We expect that our methodological approach can be adopted as a way to understand persistence and strategy-planning during visual search.},

The fundamentally different perspectives embraced in theories developed in financial economics compared with physics are dissected with the examples of the volatility smile and of the excess volatility puzzle. The role of the Ising model of phase transitions to model social and financial systems is reviewed, with the concepts of random utilities and the logit model as the analog of the Boltzmann factor in statistical physics. Recent extensions in terms of quantum decision theory are also covered. A wealth of models are discussed briefly that build on the Ising model and generalize it to account for the many stylized facts of financial markets. A summary of the relevance of the Ising model and its extensions is provided to account for financial bubbles and crashes. The review would be incomplete if it did not cover the dynamical field of agent-based models ({ABMs}), also known as computational economic models, of which the Ising-type models are just special {ABM} implementations. We formulate the 'Emerging Intelligence Market Hypothesis' to reconcile the pervasive presence of 'noise traders' with the near efficiency of financial markets.

	abstract = {We investigate a recent methodology we have proposed to extract valuable information on the competitiveness of countries and complexity of products from trade data. Standard economic theories predict a high level of specialization of countries in specific industrial sectors. However, a direct analysis of the official databases of exported products by all countries shows that the actual situation is very different. Countries commonly considered as developed ones are extremely diversified, exporting a large variety of products from very simple to very complex. At the same time countries generally considered as less developed export only the products also exported by the majority of countries. This situation calls for the introduction of a non-monetary and non-income-based measure for country economy complexity which uncovers the hidden potential for development and growth. The statistical approach we present here consists of coupled non-linear maps relating the competitiveness/fitness of countries to the complexity of their products. The fixed point of this transformation defines a metrics for the fitness of countries and the complexity of products. We argue that the key point to properly extract the economic information is the non-linearity of the map which is necessary to bound the complexity of products by the fitness of the less competitive countries exporting them. We present a detailed comparison of the results of this approach directly with those of the Method of Reflections by Hidalgo and Hausmann, showing the better performance of our method and a more solid economic, scientific and consistent foundation. © 2013 Cristelli et al.},

It is not just that thousands of individuals fly, on average, in the same direction and at the same speed, but that even the fluctuations around the mean velocity are correlated over long distances. Quantitative measurements on flocks of starlings, in particular, show that these fluctuations are scale-free, with effective correlation lengths proportional to the linear size of the flock. Here we construct models for the joint distribution of velocities in the flock that reproduce the observed local correlations between individuals and their neighbors, as well as the variance of flight speeds across individuals, but otherwise have as little structure as possible. These minimally structured, or maximum entropy models provide quantitative, parameter-free predictions for the spread of correlations throughout the flock, and these are in excellent agreement with the data. These models are mathematically equivalent to statistical physics models for ordering in magnets, and the correct prediction of scale-free correlations arises because the parameters - completely determined by the data - are in the critical regime. In biological terms, criticality allows the flock to achieve maximal correlation across long distances with limited speed fluctuations.},

The maximum entropy model shows that local, pairwise interactions between birds are sufficient to correctly predict the propagation of order throughout entire flocks of starlings, with no free parameters.

Here, we address this issue by demonstrating that a pairwise maximum entropy model, which takes into account region-specific activity rates and pairwise interactions, can be robustly and accurately fitted to resting-state human brain activities obtained by functional magnetic resonance imaging. Furthermore, to validate the approximation of the resting-state networks by the pairwise maximum entropy model, we show that the functional interactions estimated by the pairwise maximum entropy model reflect anatomical connexions more accurately than the conventional functional connectivity method.

We show that the transfer entropy provides a coherent description of information flows in and between communities, also capturing non-linear interactions. Particularly, we focus on information transfer of rare events—typically large drops which can spread in the network. These events can be analyzed by Rényi transfer entropy, which enables to accentuate particular types of events. We analyze transfer entropies between communities of the five largest financial markets and compare the information flows with the correlation network of each market. From the transfer entropy picture, we can also identify the non-linear interactions, which are typical in the case of extreme events. The strongest flows can be typically observed between specific types of business sectors—financial sectors is the most significant example.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

One highly effective approach is the optimization of the quality function known as “modularity” over the possible divisions of a network. Here I show that the modularity can be expressed in terms of the eigenvectors of a characteristic matrix for the network, which I call the modularity matrix, and that this expression leads to a spectral algorithm for community detection that returns results of demonstrably higher quality than competing methods in shorter running times.

	abstract = {The primary goal of pattern recognition is supervised or unsupervised classification. Among the various frameworks in which pattern recognition has been traditionally formulated, the statistical approach has been most intensively studied and used in practice. More recently, neural network techniques and methods imported from statistical learning theory have been receiving increasing attention. The design of a recognition system requires careful attention to the following issues: definition of pattern classes, sensing environment, pattern representation, feature extraction and selection, cluster analysis, classifier design and learning, selection of training and test samples, and performance evaluation. In spite of almost 50 years of research and development in this field, the general problem of recognizing complex patterns with arbitrary orientation, location, and scale remains unsolved. New and emerging applications, such as data mining, web searching, retrieval of multimedia data, face recognition, and cursive handwriting recognition, require robust and efficient pattern recognition techniques. The objective of this review paper is to summarize and compare some of the well-known methods used in various stages of a pattern recognition system and identify research topics and applications which are at the forefront of this exciting and challenging field.},

	abstract = {The dimension of a system is one of the most fundamental quantities to characterize its structure and basic physical properties. Diffusion and vibrational excitations, for example, as well as the universal features of a system near a critical point depend crucially on its dimension. However, in the theory of complex networks the concept of dimension has been rarely discussed. Here we study models for spatially embedded networks and show how their dimension can be determined. Our results indicate that networks characterized by a broad distribution of link lengths have a dimension higher than that of the embedding space. We illustrate our findings using the global airline network and the Internet and argue that although these networks are embedded in two-dimensional space they should be regarded as systems with dimension close to 3 and 4.5, respectively. We show that the network dimension is a key concept to understand not only network topology, but also dynamical processes on networks, such as diffusion and critical phenomena including percolation. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

The possibility of a unique growth mechanism promises to uncover universal origins of collective behaviour. In particular, the emergence of self-similarity in complex networks raises the fundamental question of the growth process according to which these structures evolve. Here we investigate the concept of renormalization as a mechanism for the growth of fractal and non-fractal modular networks. We show that the key principle that gives rise to the fractal architecture of networks is a strong effective ‘repulsion’ (or, disassortativity) between the most connected nodes (that is, the hubs) on all length scales, rendering them very dispersed. More importantly, we show that a robust network comprising functional modules, such as a cellular network, necessitates a fractal topology, suggestive of an evolutionary drive for their existence.},

In this paper, after an overview about Brazil as a whole and the comparison with the other {BRIC} countries, we introduce a new methodology based on the Fitness algorithm, called Exogenous Fitness. Combining the results with the Gross Domestic Product per capita ({GDPp}), we look at the dynamics of the Brazilian states in the Fitness-Income plane. Two regimes are distinguishable: one with high predictability and the other with low predictability, showing a deep analogy with the heterogeneous dynamics of the World countries. Furthermore, we compare the ranking of the Brazilian states according to the Exogenous Fitness with the ranking obtained through two other techniques, namely Endogenous Fitness and Economic Complexity Index.},

We model A.I. as the latest form of automation, a broader process dating back more than 200 years. Electricity, internal combustion engines, and semiconductors facilitated automation in the last century, but A.I. now seems poised to automate many tasks once thought to be out of reach, from driving cars to making medical recommendations and beyond. How will this affect economic growth and the division of income between labor and capital? What about the potential emergence of “singularities” and “superintelligence,” concepts that animate many discussions in the machine intelligence community? How will the linkages between A.I. and growth be mediated by firm-level considerations, including organization and market structure? The goal throughout is to refine a set of critical questions about A.I. and economic growth and to contribute to shaping an agenda for the field. One theme that emerges is based on Baumol’s “cost disease” insight: growth may be constrained not by what we are good at but rather by what is essential and yet hard to improve.},

The underlying idea is that growth, development, technological change, income inequality, spatial disparities, and resilience are the visible outcomes of hidden systemic interactions. The study of economic complexity seeks to understand the structure of these interactions and how they shape various socioeconomic processes. This emerging field relies heavily on big data and machine learning techniques. This brief introduction to economic complexity has three aims. The first is to summarize key theoretical foundations and principles of economic complexity. The second is to briefly review the tools and metrics developed in the economic complexity literature that exploit information encoded in the structure of the economy to find new empirical patterns. The final aim is to highlight the insights from economic complexity to improve prediction and political decision-making. Institutions including the World Bank, the European Commission, the World Economic Forum, the {OECD}, and a range of national and regional organizations have begun to embrace the principles of economic complexity and its analytical framework. We discuss policy implications of this field, in particular the usefulness of building recommendation systems for major public investment decisions in a complex world.},

	abstract = {A country's mix of products predicts its subsequent pattern of diversification and economic growth. But does this product mix also predict income inequality? Here we combine methods from econometrics, network science, and economic complexity to show that countries exporting complex products—as measured by the Economic Complexity Index—have lower levels of income inequality than countries exporting simpler products. Using multivariate regression analysis, we show that economic complexity is a significant and negative predictor of income inequality and that this relationship is robust to controlling for aggregate measures of income, institutions, export concentration, and human capital. Moreover, we introduce a measure that associates a product to a level of income inequality equal to the average {GINI} of the countries exporting that product (weighted by the share the product represents in that country's export basket). We use this measure together with the network of related products—or product space—to illustrate how the development of new products is associated with changes in income inequality. These findings show that economic complexity captures information about an economy's level of development that is relevant to the ways an economy generates and distributes its income. Moreover, these findings suggest that a country's productive structure may limit its range of income inequality. Finally, we make our results available through an online resource that allows for its users to visualize the structural transformation of over 150 countries and their associated changes in income inequality during 1963–2008.},

We show a complex growth dynamic using data covering two decades (1995–2014) for a large set of countries. This pattern indicates that the observed sequences of spells vary substantially even between countries within the same growth regime (low, medium, and high). Moreover, we find a robust statistical relationship between these spells and Economic Fitness with a multinomial econometric model.

The surveys lay out a clear indicator of the rise of extreme views. The precursor is a nonlinear relation between the fraction of individuals holding a certain extreme view and the fraction of individuals that includes also moderates, e.g., in politics, those who are “very conservative” versus “moderate to very conservative” ones. We propose an activation model of opinion dynamics with interaction rules based on the existence of individual “stubbornness” that mimics empirical observations. According to our modeling, the onset of nonlinearity can be associated to an abrupt bootstrap-percolation transition with cascades of extreme views through society. Therefore, it represents an early-warning signal to forecast the transition from moderate to extreme views. Moreover, by means of a phase diagram we can classify societies according to the percolative regime they belong to, in terms of critical fractions of extremists and people’s ties.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Here, we propose a complementary approach based on deep learning where effective local mechanisms governing a dynamic on a network are learned from time series data. Our graph neural network architecture makes very few assumptions about the dynamics, and we demonstrate its accuracy using different contagion dynamics of increasing complexity. By allowing simulations on arbitrary network structures, our approach makes it possible to explore the properties of the learned dynamics beyond the training data.

Considering the complex interactions between different structural and functional brain regions, brain network has received a lot of attention and has made great progress in brain mechanism research. In addition, characterized by autonomous, multi-layer and diversified feature extraction, deep learning has provided an effective and feasible solution for solving complex classification problems in many fields, including brain state research. Both of them show strong ability in {EEG} signal analysis, but the combination of these two theories to solve the difficult classification problems based on {EEG} signals is still in its infancy. We here review the application of these two theories in {EEG} signal research, mainly involving brain–computer interface, neurological disorders and cognitive analysis. Furthermore, we also develop a framework combining recurrence plots and convolutional neural network to achieve fatigue driving recognition.

We show that this approach succeeds in finding statistically significant assortative modules in networks, unlike alternatives such as modularity maximization, which systematically overfits both in artificial as well as in empirical examples. In addition, we show that our method is not subject to a resolution limit, and can uncover an arbitrarily large number of communities, as long as there is statistical evidence for them. Our formulation is amenable to model selection procedures, which allow us to compare it to more general approaches based on the stochastic block model, and in this way reveal whether assortativity is in fact the dominating large-scale mixing pattern. We perform this comparison with several empirical networks, and identify numerous cases where the network’s assortativity is exaggerated by traditional community detection methods, and we show how a more faithful degree of assortativity can be identified.},

	abstract = {Quantum percolation describes the problem of a quantum particle moving through a disordered system. While certain similarities to classical percolation exist, the quantum case has additional complexity due to the possibility of Anderson localisation. Here, we consider a directed discrete-time quantum walk as a model to study quantum percolation of a two-state particle on a two-dimensional lattice. Using numerical analysis we determine the fraction of connected edges required (transition point) in the lattice for the two-state particle to percolate with finite (non-zero) probability for three fundamental lattice geometries, finite square lattice, honeycomb lattice, and nanotube structure and show that it tends towards unity for increasing lattice sizes. To support the numerical results we also use a continuum approximation to analytically derive the expression for the percolation probability for the case of the square lattice and show that it agrees with the numerically obtained results for the discrete case. Beyond the fundamental interest to understand the dynamics of a two-state particle on a lattice (network) with disconnected vertices, our study has the potential to shed light on the transport dynamics in various quantum condensed matter systems and the construction of quantum information processing and communication protocols.},

A cognitive task that is rather frequent in our daily life is the visual search for hidden objects. Here we investigate through eye-tracking experiments the statistical properties associated with the search of target images embedded in a landscape of distractors. Specifically, our results show that the twofold process of eye movement, composed of sequences of fixations (small steps) intercalated by saccades (longer jumps), displays characteristic statistical signatures. While the saccadic jumps follow a log-normal distribution of distances, which is typical of multiplicative processes, the lengths of the smaller steps in the fixation trajectories are consistent with a power-law distribution. Moreover, the present analysis reveals a clear transition between a directional serial search to an isotropic random movement as the difficulty level of the searching task is increased.},

In this theory, the strength of Anderson localization confinement is determined by this landscape, and continuously decreases as the energy increases. However, this picture has to be changed in discrete lattices in which the eigenmodes close to the edge of the first Brillouin zone are as localized as the low energy ones. Here we show that in a 1D discrete lattice, the localization of low and high energy modes is governed by two different landscapes, the high energy landscape being the solution of a dual Dirichlet problem deduced from the low energy one using the symmetries of the Hamiltonian. We illustrate this feature using the one-dimensional tight-binding Hamiltonian with random on-site potentials as a prototype model. Moreover we show that, besides unveiling the subregions of Anderson localization, these dual landscapes also provide an accurate overall estimate of the localization length over the energy spectrum, especially in the weak-disorder regime.},

Asymptotic forms are obtained for the scaling function P(G) ={dlnG}/{dlnL},. valid for both G«G, = e2/"' and G» G,. In three dimensions, G, is an unstable fixed point. In two dimensions, there is no true metallic behavior; the con-ductance crosses over smoothly from logarithmic or slower to exponential decrease with L. Scaling theories of localization have been discussed by Thouless and co-authors' ' and by Weg-ner. Recently Schuster, ' using methods related to those of Aharony and Imry, ' has proposed a close relationship of the localization problem to a dirty {XY} model of the same dimensionality. Wegner has proposed a scaling for dimensionality d 2 of the conductivity (E E)(d-2)v while Schuster identifies v as the correlation-length exponent of the {XF} model-2 at d \&4. The latter proposes a universal jump of conductivity for d=2 given by e'/hm'. This is not inconsistent with the results of Wegner4 and is in rough agreement with the early calculations of Ref. 2. It has not been clear how (1) could be reconciled with the physical ideas of Mott' as related to the beginning of a scaling theory by Thouless. ' We here develop a renormalization-group scheme based on the Mott-Thouless arguments, which in many essential ways agrees with Wegner's results , and in other ways severely disagrees. In particular, we recover (1) for d\&2, where v is the localization-length exponent below E,. This is in clear contradiction to Mott, ' who argues that in all cases the conductivity jumps to zero at E,. At d =2, we find no jump in o but a steep cross-over from exponential to very slow dependence on size. There is no true metallic conductivity. These results were presaged by Thouless and co-workers" to some extent, with Ref. 8 indicating a transition pegion for three dimensions, and Ref. 9 a size-dependent minimum metallic conductivity. Our ideas are based on the relationship' between conductance as determined by the Kubo-Greenwood formula and the response to perturbation of boundary conditions in a finite sample described by Thouless and co-workers' "U" {\textasciitilde} 25 25 W {dE}/{dN} e' e' (2) Here G is the conductance (not conductivity o) of a hypercube of size L" [here L»\&L, (L, =micro-scopic size)j, {dE}/{dN} is the mean spacing of its energy levels, and {\textasciitilde} is the geometric mean of the fluctuation in energy levels caused by replacing periodic by antiperiodic boundary conditions. Actually, when "V/W" is relatively large, it is hard to match the energy levels and, in fact, b,E is defined using the curvature for small y when we replace periodic g(n+ 1) =\$(1) by g(n+ 1) =e'" x ((1) boundary conditions. This procedure is valid throughout the ra, nge of interest. ' We will comment on the validity of (2) in a fuller paper, but here we add the following remarks. The equivalence of the Kubo-Greenwood formula and the breadth v of the distribution of 4E as described in Ref.

	abstract = {We present a self-consistent theory of the frequency-dependent conductivity with no adjustable parameters for a tight-binding model with random energy levels, using the locator expansion. The resulting phase diagram and the conductivity and localization length as a function of energy and disorder are in quantitative agreement with results of numerical diagonalization of finite-size systems. The results demonstrate for the first time that quantum interference {eA}'ects are responsible for localization over the complete energy range, including the band edges. Just about 30 years ago Anderson' introduced the notion of localization of a quantum particle in a random potential. The importance of the idea was recognized by Mott and by Thouless, who extended and refined the concept and explored its application to electron transport in solids. It took about 20 yrs until it was realized that the Anderson transition is in fact a continuous phase transition characterized by a diverging length, critical exponents , and an order parameter. The precise form of the scaling at the localization transition, in particular whether more than one scaling parameter is required in the strong-coupling regime, is presently a matter of controversy. ' In the framework of our theory one-parameter scaling is an inescapable consequence unless there exist as yet undiscovered singularities of a new type in terms of perturbation theory omitted in our approximation. In the following, we will take one-parameter scaling theory for granted at least in a certain vicinity of the transition , if not the critical regime itself. The question then remaining is how to connect the critical regime with the parameters of the Hamiltonian in a quantitative way. It is this question to which the present paper attempts to provide a comprehensive answer. Early attempts to establish this relation led to the formulation of self-consistent theories, "' which indeed yielded scaling in agreement" with field-theoretic treatments ' up to three-loop order in the e expansion. While this was encouraging, these theories were not yet fully re-normalized, e.g. , in that the coupling constant and the density of states entering the self-consistent equation were only evaluated in weak coupling. A qualitative renormal-ization of the self-consistent theory ({SCT}) using the analogy to single-particle localization in an average potential well was attempted by Economou and co-workers. ' ' In this paper we calculate the parameters of the {SCT} for a random tight-binding model in single-site approximation using a formulation based on the locator expansion.

In particular, the second-order correlation function is diagonal in the shell index and the third-order correlation exists only between three consecutive shells. Spurious oscillations in the scaling regime, which are an annoying feature of the {GOY} model, are eliminated by our choice of nonlinear coupling. We demonstrate that the model exhibits multiscaling similar to the {GOY} model. The scaling exponents are shown to be independent of the viscous mechanism as is expected for Navier-Stokes turbulence and other shell models. These properties of the model make it optimal for further attempts to achieve understanding of multiscaling in nonlinear dynamics. S1063-651X9810007-7 {PACS} numbers: 47.27.i},

	abstract = {Which statistical features of spiking activity matter for how stimuli are encoded in neural populations? A vast body of work has explored how firing rates in individual cells and correlations in the spikes of cell pairs impact coding. Recent experiments have shown evidence for the existence of higher-order spiking correlations, which describe simultaneous firing in triplets and larger ensembles of cells; however, little is known about their impact on encoded stimulus information. Here, we take a first step toward closing this gap. We vary triplet correlations in small (approximately 10 cell) neural populations while keeping single cell and pairwise statistics fixed at typically reported values. This connection with empirically observed lower-order statistics is important, as it places strong constraints on the level of triplet correlations that can occur. For each value of triplet correlations, we estimate the performance of the neural population on a two-stimulus discrimination task. We find that the allowed changes in the level of triplet correlations can significantly enhance coding, in particular if triplet correlations differ for the two stimuli. In this scenario, triplet correlations must be included in order to accurately quantify the functionality of neural populations. When both stimuli elicit similar triplet correlations, however, pairwise models provide relatively accurate descriptions of coding accuracy. We explain our findings geometrically via the skew that triplet correlations induce in population-wide distributions of neural responses.

	abstract = {Videos and commercials produced for large audiences can elicit mixed opinions. We wondered whether this diversity is also reflected in the way individuals watch the videos. To answer this question, we presented 65 commercials with high production value to 25 individuals while recording their eye movements, and asked them to provide preference ratings for each video. We find that gaze positions for the most popular videos are highly correlated. To explain the correlations of eye movements, we model them as "interactions" between individuals. A thermodynamic analysis of these interactions shows that they approach a "critical" point such that any stronger interaction would put all viewers into lock-step and any weaker interaction would fully randomise patterns. At this critical point, groups with similar collective behaviour in viewing patterns emerge while maintaining diversity between groups. Our results suggest that popularity of videos is already evident in the way we look at them, and that we maintain diversity in viewing behaviour even as distinct patterns of groups emerge. Our results can be used to predict popularity of videos and commercials at the population level from the collective behaviour of the eye movements of a few viewers.},

	abstract = {The recovery performance of immiscible and miscible {CO} 2 huff-and-puff processes for enhanced oil recovery ({EOR}) in a light crude oil sample was experimentally investigated. The minimum miscibility pressure ({MMP}) of the original light crude oil−{CO} 2 system was determined by means of the vanishing interfacial tension technique and found to be {MMP} = 9.18 {MPa}. Then, the solubility of the {CO} 2 in the light crude oil and oil swelling factor due to the {CO} 2 dissolution in the oil phase were determined at T = 30 °C and various equilibrium pressures ranging from atmospheric pressure to P eq = 12.55 {MPa}. Later, series of immiscible and miscible {CO} 2 huff-and-puff tests were designed and carried out at various operating pressures (i.e., P op = 5.38− 10.34 {MPa}). The results of the experiments showed that for secondary {CO} 2 huff-and-puff tests performed at the operating pressures below the {MMP}, the ultimate oil recovery factor is quite low. It was also found that in immiscible {CO} 2 huff-and-puff (i.e., P op {\textless} {MMP}) scenarios, the oil recovery factor substantially increased as the operating pressure approached near-miscible conditions. The oil recovery factor almost reached its maximum value at operating pressure near {MMP} (i.e., miscible condition), and further increase of operating pressure beyond {MMP} did not improve the recovery factor at all. The tertiary mode of miscible {CO} 2 huff-and-puff was also examined, and it was revealed that the oil recovery is significantly improved after a waterflooding process. The oil recovery mechanisms during the {CO} 2 huff-and-puff were mainly recognized to be interfacial tension reduction, oil swelling, and extraction of lighter components by {CO} 2 , especially during miscible {CO} 2 injections. In addition, the average asphaltene content of produced oil and the permeability reduction of the porous medium as a result of asphaltene precipitation were measured in each test. It was found that the amount of precipitated asphaltene in the porous medium as well as permeability reduction are considerably higher in near-miscible and miscible {CO} 2 huff-and-puff tests compared to those in immiscible cases. The compositional analysis of remaining oil from {CO} 2 huff-and-puff tests at immiscible and miscible conditions also showed that lighter components of oil are extracted by {CO} 2 , leading the remaining oil to become heavier with greater amounts of heavy hydrocarbons (i.e., C 30+). However, it was observed that the extraction of lighter components during miscible injection processes is more predominant than that during immiscible injections, resulting in the production of higher quality oil.},

The method thus yields a ‘cartographic representation’ of complex networks. Metabolic networks6,7,8 are among the most challenging biological networks and, arguably, the ones with most potential for immediate applicability9. We use our method to analyse the metabolic networks of twelve organisms from three different superkingdoms. We find that, typically, 80\% of the nodes are only connected to other nodes within their respective modules, and that nodes with different roles are affected by different evolutionary constraints and pressures. Remarkably, we find that metabolites that participate in only a few reactions but that connect different modules are more conserved than hubs whose links are mostly within a single module.},

In this study, data from Israel's largest health care organization were used to evaluate the effectiveness of the {BNT}162b2 {mRNA} vaccine. {METHODS} All persons who were newly vaccinated during the period from December 20, 2020, to February 1, 2021, were matched to unvaccinated controls in a 1:1 ratio according to demographic and clinical characteristics. Study outcomes included documented infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ({SARS}-{CoV}-2), symptomatic Covid-19, Covid-19-related hospitalization, severe illness, and death. We estimated vaccine effectiveness for each outcome as one minus the risk ratio, using the Kaplan-Meier estimator. {RESULTS} Each study group included 596,618 persons. Estimated vaccine effectiveness for the study outcomes at days 14 through 20 after the first dose and at 7 or more days after the second dose was as follows: for documented infection, 46\% (95\% confidence interval [{CI}], 40 to 51) and 92\% (95\% {CI}, 88 to 95); for symptomatic Covid-19, 57\% (95\% {CI}, 50 to 63) and 94\% (95\% {CI}, 87 to 98); for hospitalization, 74\% (95\% {CI}, 56 to 86) and 87\% (95\% {CI}, 55 to 100); and for severe disease, 62\% (95\% {CI}, 39 to 80) and 92\% (95\% {CI}, 75 to 100), respectively. Estimated effectiveness in preventing death from Covid-19 was 72\% (95\% {CI}, 19 to 100) for days 14 through 20 after the first dose. Estimated effectiveness in specific subpopulations assessed for documented infection and symptomatic Covid-19 was consistent across age groups, with potentially slightly lower effectiveness in persons with multiple coexisting conditions. {CONCLUSIONS} This study in a nationwide mass vaccination setting suggests that the {BNT}162b2 {mRNA} vaccine is effective for a wide range of Covid-19-related outcomes, a finding consistent with that of the randomized trial.},

Despite its widespread use, it relies on adjustable parameters that vary from region to region and suffers from known analytic inconsistencies. Here we introduce a stochastic process capturing local mobility decisions that helps us analytically derive commuting and mobility fluxes that require as input only information on the population distribution. The resulting radiation model predicts mobility patterns in good agreement with mobility and transport patterns observed in a wide range of phenomena, from long-term migration patterns to communication volume between different regions. Given its parameter-free nature, the model can be applied in areas where we lack previous mobility measurements, significantly improving the predictive accuracy of most of the phenomena affected by mobility and transport processes. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

We investigate through numerical simulations of the Navier-Stokes equations the influence of the surface roughness on the fluid flow through fracture joints. Using the Hurst exponent H to characterize the roughness of the self-affine surfaces that constitute the fracture, our analysis reveals the important interplay between geometry and inertia on the flow. Precisely, for low values of Reynolds numbers, Re, we use Darcy's law to quantify the hydraulic resistance G of the fracture and show that its dependence on H can be explained in terms of a simple geometrical model for the geometric tortuosity τ of the channel. At sufficiently high values of Re, when inertial effects become relevant, our results reveal that nonlinear corrections up to third order to Darcy's law are approximately proportional to H. These results imply that the resistance G to the flow follows a universal behavior by simply rescaling it in terms of the fracture resistivity and using an effective Reynolds number, namely, Re/H. Our results also reveal the presence of quasi-one-dimensional channeling, even considering the absence of shear displacement between upper and lower surfaces of the self-affine fracture.},

	title = {Linearly forced isotropic turbulence},
	abstract = {Stationary isotropic turbulence is often studied numerically by adding a forcing term to the Navier-Stokes equation. This is usually done for the purpose of achieving higher Reynolds number and longer statistics than is possible for isotropic decaying turbulence. It is generally accepted that forcing the Navier-Stokes equation at low wave number does not influence the small scale statistics of the flow provided that there is wide separation between the largest and smallest scales. It will be shown, however, that the spectral width of the forcing has a noticeable effect on inertial range statistics. A case will be made here for using a broader form of forcing in order to compare computed isotropic stationary turbulence with (decaying) grid turbulence. It is shown that using a forcing function which is directly proportional to the velocity has physical meaning and gives results which are closer to both homogeneous and non-homogeneous turbulence. Section 1 presents a four part series of motivations for linear forcing. Section 2 puts linear forcing to a numerical test with a pseudospectral computation. 1. Motivation for Linear Forcing 1.1.

This suggests that for isotropic homogeneous turbulence it might be appropriate to force a stationary flow with a driving term proportional to the velocity. Of course, for isotropic turbulence there is no mean velocity gradient, so the only way to have the flow be isotropic and stationary is to have the forcing be isotropic. It is proposed here to use o-+ U. Vu =-Vp/p + {vV} 2 u + f (2) with the driving force f =Qu, (3) where Q is a constant. The prime on the velocity has been omitted here and henceforth with the understanding that {\textless} u {\textgreater}= 0.

Results show that proper upwind-biased difference schemes can release the limit of " start-up " problem to Mach numbers. Compressibility effects on the statistics of turbulent flow as well as the mechanics of shocklets in compressible turbulence are also studied, and the conclusion is drawn that high Mach number leads to more dissipation. Scaling laws in compressible turbulence are also analyzed. Evidence is obtained that scaling laws and extended self similarity ({ESS}) hold in the compressible turbulent flow in spite of the presence of shocklets, and compressibility has little effect on scaling exponents. Direct numerical simulation ({DNS}) as a tool in the investigation of turbulence plays a more and more important role in recent turbulence researches. With the limit of computers, {DNS} pres-ently can only be performed for low Reynolds numbers and relatively simple boundary conditions. Since 1972, there have been many {DNS} cases of isotropic turbulence, but most of those refer to incompressible flow (see ref. [1] for a review). However, many engineering problems (such as problems related to aeronautics and astronautics) are related to compressible turbulence, so {DNS} of compressible turbulence is also very important. The work documented in ref. [2] performed {DNS} of compressible isotropic turbulence by using 10th order Pade schemes and a skew-symmetric form [3] of non-viscous term to de-aliasing. The random eddy shocklets are analyzed in this paper. Limited by the start-up problem, turbulence Mach numbers in ref. [2] are not more than 0.5. The start-up problem consists in the development},

	abstract = {When discussing research in physics and in science more generally, it is common to ascribe equal importance to the three components of the scientific trinity: theoretical, experimental, and computational studies. This review will explore the future of modern turbulence theory by tracing its history, which began in earnest with Kolmogorov's 1941 analysis of turbulence cascade and inertial range [A.N. Kolmogorov, Dokl. Akad. Nauk {SSSR}, 30, 299, (1941); 32, 19, (1941)]. The 80th Anniversary of Kolmogorov's landmark study is a welcome opportunity to survey the achievements and evaluate the future of the theoretical approach of turbulence research. Over the years, turbulence theories have been critically important in laying the foundation of our understanding of the nature of turbulent flows. In particular, the Direct Interaction Approximation ({DIA}) [R.H. Kraichnan, J. Fluid Mech., 5, 497 (1959)] and its subsequent development, known as the statistical closure approach, can be identified as perhaps the most profound single advancement. The remarkable success of the statistical closure has furnished a platform to study such essential concepts as the energy transfer process and interacting scales, and the roles of the straining and sweeping motions. More recently, the quasi-Lagrangian formulation of V. L'vov \& I. Procaccia and Kraichnan's solvable passive scalar model provided powerful ways to explore another fundamental aspect of turbulent flows, the phenomena of intermittency, and the associated anomalous scaling exponents. In the meantime, the theory of fluid equilibria has been developed to describe the large-scale structures that can emerge from turbulent cascades of two-dimensional and geophysical flows at a later time. And yet, despite all these successes, analytical treatments suffer from mathematical complexities. As a result, the utility of theoretical approaches has been limited to relatively idealized flows. On the other hand, in recent decades, computational abilities and experimental facilities have reached an unprecedented scale. Looking beyond the horizon, the imminent deployment of exascale supercomputers will generate complete datasets of the entire flow field of key benchmark flows, allowing researchers to extract additional measurements concerning fully developed, complex turbulent flow fields far beyond those available from the statistical closure theories. Some other developments that could potentially influence the future course of turbulence theories include the advancement of machine learning, artificial intelligence, and data science; likely disruptions arising from the advent of quantum computation; and the increasingly prominent role of turbulence research in providing more accurate climate scientific data. Turbulence theorists can leverage these developments by asking the right questions and developing advanced, sophisticated frameworks that will be able to predict and correlate vast amounts of data from the other two components of the trinity.},

In addition, most classic studies use spectral methods due to its accuracy and lack of numerical dissipation. However, the effects of mesh refinement on turbulence structure was not much explored in the literature, mainly when finite volume methods (instead of usual spectral ones) are used to integrate the flow equations. In the present paper, {DNS} of a single phase channel flow is performed solving the primitive variables in space and time domains, using the Finite Volume Method and its influence on turbulence statistics is analyzed based on four different meshes. The results show some differences in turbulent statistics according to the resolution adopted and confirm that a turbulence analysis can be performed in domains without extreme refinement, at least, for lower order statistics.},

So far, validation of the proposed predictors has been done by simulating the spreading dynamics rather than following real information flow in social networks. Consequently, only model-dependent contradictory results have been achieved so far for the best predictor. Here, we address this issue directly. We search for influential spreaders by following the real spreading dynamics in a wide range of networks. We find that the widely-used degree and {PageRank} fail in ranking users' influence. We find that the best spreaders are consistently located in the k-core across dissimilar social platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, Livejournal and scientific publishing in the American Physical Society. Furthermore, when the complete global network structure is unavailable, we find that the sum of the nearest neighbors' degree is a reliable local proxy for user's influence.

Thus, the analyses proposed by this study aimed at identifying the impact of climate change on naturalised streamflows and Affluent Natural Energy ({NEA}) projections for the Brazilian electricity sector using six models of the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment ({CORDEX}) project, based on the {RCP} 4.5 and {RCP} 8.5 scenarios for the 21st century. The streamflows for the 24 stations representing the National Interconnected System ({NIS}) were estimated through the concentrated hydrological model {SMAP} (Soil Moisture Accounting Procedure), while the streamflows for the other stations that comprise the {NIS} were obtained by linear regression. The streamflows, as well as the productivity of the reservoirs, were used to calculate the {NEA}. The results showed that most of the models project possible reductions in annual naturalized streamflows and {NEA} for the three periods analyzed and for the North, Northeast and Southeast/Midwest sectors. Meanwhile, in the Southern sector, for the period 2010-2039, most of the models indicated an increase in the annual naturalized streamflows and {NEA}.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Abstract The Xingu River, one of the most important of the Amazon Basin, is characterized by clear and transparent waters that drain a 509.685 km2 watershed with distinct hydrological and ecological conditions and anthropogenic pressures along its course. As in other basins of the Amazon system, studies in the Xingu are scarce. Furthermore, the eminent construction of the Belo Monte for hydropower production, which will alter the environmental conditions in the basin in its lower middle portion, denotes high importance of studies that generate relevant information that may subsidize a more balanced and equitable development in the Amazon region. Thus, the aim of this study was to analyze the water quality in the Xingu River and its tributaries focusing on spatial patterns by the use of multivariate statistical techniques, identifying which water quality parameters were more important for the environmental changes in the watershed. Data sampling were carried out during two complete hydrological cycles in twenty-five sampling stations. The data of twenty seven variables were analyzed by Spearman's correlation coefficients, cluster analysis ({CA}), and principal component analysis ({PCA}). The results showed a high auto-correlation between variables (\&gt; 0.7). These variables were removed from multivariate analyzes because they provided redundant information about the environment. The {CA} resulted in the formation of six clusters, which were clearly observed in the {PCA} and were characterized by different water quality. The statistical results allowed to identify a high spatial variation in the water quality, which were related to specific features of the environment, different uses, influences of anthropogenic activities and geochemical characteristics of the drained basins. It was also demonstrated that most of the sampling stations in the Xingu River basin showed good water quality, due to the absence of local impacts and high power of depuration of the river itself.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

To verify the relationship between the variables we used wavelet coherence analysis. A preliminary detection skill test was performed using asynthetic series and Pruned Exact Linear Time ({PELT}) presented the best results among the methods used (Pettitt test, Bai and Perron algorithm) when combined with a penalty selection via the Changepoints for a Range of Penalties ({CROPS}) method. However, the use of classical penalty functions resulted in a poor performance of {PELT}. The three methods showed an extremely high convergence rate ({\textgreater} 90\%) for the correct change points and a smaller rate for false positives ({\textless} 24\%). Changes in the streamflow mean value coincided with phase shift of the low-frequency indices Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation ({AMO}) and Pacific Decadal Oscillation ({PDO}), also corroborated by the wavelet results. Most of the changes can be associated with phase shift impacts in the South Atlantic Convergence Zone.},

	abstract = {In many real-world networks, the ability to withstand targeted or global attacks; extinctions; or shocks is vital to the survival of the network itself, and of dependent structures such as economies (for financial networks) or even the planet (for ecosystems). Previous attempts to characterise robustness include nestedness of mutualistic networks or exploration of degree distribution. In this work we present a new approach for characterising the stability and robustness of networks with all-positive interactions by studying the distribution of the k-shell of the underlying network. We find that high occupancy of nodes in the inner and outer k-shells and low occupancy in the middle shells of financial and ecological networks (yielding a "U-shape" in a histogram of k-shell occupancy) provide resilience against both local targeted and global attacks. Investigation of this highly-populated core gives insights into the nature of a network (such as sharp transitions in the core composition of the stock market from a mix of industries to domination by one or two in the mid-1990s) and allow predictions of future network stability, e.g., by monitoring populations of "core" species in an ecosystem or noting when stocks in the core-dominant sector begin to move in lock-step, presaging a dramatic move in the market. Moreover, this "U-shape" recalls core-periphery structure, seen in a wide range of networks including opinion and internet networks, suggesting that the "U-shaped" occupancy histogram and its implications for network health may indeed be universal.},

Here, we use a dataset of 171 million tweets in the five months preceding the election day to identify 30 million tweets, from 2.2 million users, which contain a link to news outlets. Based on a classification of news outlets curated by www.opensources.co, we find that 25\% of these tweets spread either fake or extremely biased news. We characterize the networks of information flow to find the most influential spreaders of fake and traditional news and use causal modeling to uncover how fake news influenced the presidential election. We find that, while top influencers spreading traditional center and left leaning news largely influence the activity of Clinton supporters, this causality is reversed for the fake news: the activity of Trump supporters influences the dynamics of the top fake news spreaders.},

	abstract = {Complex systems such as ecological communities and neuron networks are essential parts of our everyday lives. These systems are composed of units which interact through intricate networks. The ability to predict sudden changes in the dynamics of these networks, known as critical transitions, from data is important to avert disastrous consequences of major disruptions. Predicting such changes is a major challenge as it requires forecasting the behavior for parameter ranges for which no data on the system are available. We address this issue for networks with weak individual interactions and chaotic local dynamics. We do this by building a model network, termed an effective network, consisting of the underlying local dynamics and a statistical description of their interactions. We show that behavior of such networks can be decomposed in terms of an emergent deterministic component and a fluctuation term. Traditionally, such fluctuations are filtered out. However, as we show, they are key to accessing the interaction structure. We illustrate this approach on synthetic time series of realistic neuronal interaction networks of the cat cerebral cortex and on experimental multivariate data of optoelectronic oscillators. We reconstruct the community structure by analyzing the stochastic fluctuations generated by the network and predict critical transitions for coupling parameters outside the observed range.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Knowing the prevalence of true asymptomatic coronavirus disease 2019 ({COVID}-19) cases is critical for designing mitigation measures against the pandemic. We aimed to synthesize all available research on asymptomatic cases and transmission rates. {METHODS}: We searched {PubMed}, Embase, Cochrane {COVID}-19 trials, and Europe {PMC} for primary studies on asymptomatic prevalence in which (1) the sample frame includes at-risk populations and (2) follow-up was sufficient to identify pre-symptomatic cases. Meta-analysis used fixed-effects and random-effects models. We assessed risk of bias by combination of questions adapted from risk of bias tools for prevalence and diagnostic accuracy studies. {RESULTS}: We screened 2,454 articles and included 13 low risk-of-bias studies from seven countries that tested 21,708 at-risk people, of which 663 were positive and 111 asymptomatic. Diagnosis in all studies was confirmed using a real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction test. The asymptomatic proportion ranged from 4\% to 41\%. Meta-analysis (fixed effects) found that the proportion of asymptomatic cases was 17\% (95\% {CI} 14\% to 20\%) overall and higher in aged care (20\%; 95\% {CI} 14\% to 27\%) than in non-aged care (16\%; 95\% {CI} 13\% to 20\%). The relative risk ({RR}) of asymptomatic transmission was 42\% lower than that for symptomatic transmission (combined {RR} 0.58; 95\% {CI} 0.34 to 0.99, p = 0.047). {CONCLUSIONS}: Our one-in-six estimate of the prevalence of asymptomatic {COVID}-19 cases and asymptomatic transmission rates is lower than those of many highly publicized studies but still sufficient to warrant policy attention. Further robust epidemiological evidence is urgently needed, including in subpopulations such as children, to better understand how asymptomatic cases contribute to the pandemic.},

	doi = {10.1175/MWR-D-11-00176.1},
	abstract = {The study considers an iterative formulation of the ensemble Kalman filter ({EnKF}) for strongly nonlinear systems in the perfect-model framework. In the first part, a scheme is introduced that is similar to the en- semble randomized maximal likelihood ({EnRML}) filter by Gu and Oliver. The two new elements in the scheme are the use of the ensemble square root filter instead of the traditional (perturbed observations) {EnKF} and rescaling of the ensemble anomalies with the ensemble transform matrix from the previous iteration instead of estimating sensitivities between the ensemble observations and ensemble anomalies at the start of the assimilation cycle by linear regression. A simple modification turns the scheme into an ensemble for- mulation of the iterative extended Kalman filter. The two versions of the algorithm are referred to as the iterative {EnKF} ({IEnKF}) and the iterative extended Kalman filter ({IEKF}). In the second part, the performance of the {IEnKF} and {IEKF} is tested in five numerical experiments: two with the 3-element Lorenz model and three with the 40-element Lorenz model. Both the {IEnKF} and {IEKF} show a considerable advantage over the {EnKF} in strongly nonlinear systems when the quality or density of observations are sufficient to constrain the model to the regime of mainly linear propagation of the ensemble anomalies as well as constraining the fast-growing modes, with a much smaller advantage otherwise. The {IEnKF} and {IEKF} can potentially be used with large-scale models, and can represent a robust and scalable alternative to particle filter ({PF}) and hybrid {PF}-{EnKF} schemes in strongly nonlinear systems. © 2012 American Meteorological Society.},

Strong nonstationarities impede statistical convergence, precluding quantifying turbulence, for example, in terms of turbulence intensity or Reynolds number. Here, we show that by using deep neural networks, we can accurately estimate the Reynolds number within 15\% accuracy, from a statistical sample as small as two large-scale eddy turnover times. In contrast, physics-based statistical estimators are limited by the convergence rate of the central limit theorem and provide, for the same statistical sample, at least a hundredfold larger error. Our findings open up previously unexplored perspectives and the possibility to quantitatively define and, therefore, study highly nonstationary turbulent flows as ordinarily found in nature and in industrial processes.},

However, exports fraud may occur with objectives not related to tax evasion, for example money laundering. This article presents the results obtained in implementing the unsupervised Deep Learning model to classify Brazilian exporters regarding the possibility of committing fraud in exports. Assuming that the vast majority of exporters have explanatory features of their export volume which interrelate in a standard way, we used the {AutoEncoder} to detect anomalous situations with regards to the data pattern. The databases used in this work come from exports of goods and products that occurred in Brazil in 2014, provided by the Secretariat of Federal Revenue of Brazil. From attributes that characterize export companies, the model was able to detect anomalies in at least twenty exporters. {NR}  - 26 {PU}  - {IEEE} {PI}  - {NEW} {YORK} {PA}  - 345 E 47TH {ST}, {NEW} {YORK}, {NY} 10017 {USA}},

	abstract = {Conventional lattice Boltzmann models for the simulation of fluid dynamics are restricted by an error in the stress tensor that is negligible only for small flow velocity and at a singular value of the temperature. To that end, we propose a unified formulation that restores Galilean invariance and the isotropy of the stress tensor by introducing an extended equilibrium. This modification extends lattice Boltzmann models to simulations with higher values of the flow velocity and can be used at temperatures that are higher than the lattice reference temperature, which enhances computational efficiency by decreasing the number of required time steps. Furthermore, the extended model also remains valid for stretched lattices, which are useful when flow gradients are predominant in one direction. The model is validated by simulations of two- and three-dimensional benchmark problems, including the double shear layer flow, the decay of homogeneous isotropic turbulence, the laminar boundary layer over a flat plate and the turbulent channel flow.},

Two models, D3Q15 and D3Q19, are used in the investigation. Results demonstrate that the Lattice Boltzmann Method can capture important features of turbulence such as the vortex-like tubes and the Kolmogorov -5/3 power spectrum. Visualization of the elongated vortices using the high rotational identification method, Q, is also presented. For 2563, a longer range of the Kolmogorov -5/3 slope can be observed than in the case of 1283 grid points. As the resolution increases, the turbulence characteristics of the flow are found to become similar to those obtained in studies by the spectral method regardless of which model is used. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

In different contexts, these influencers are defined as either structurally important nodes that maintain the connectivity of networks, or dynamically crucial units that can disproportionately impact certain dynamical processes. In practice, identification of the optimal set of influencers in a given system has profound implications in a variety of disciplines. In this review, we survey recent advances in the study of influencer identification developed from different perspectives, and present state-of-the-art solutions designed for different objectives. In particular, we first discuss the problem of finding the minimal number of nodes whose removal would breakdown the network (i.e. the optimal percolation or network dismantle problem), and then survey methods to locate the essential nodes that are capable of shaping global dynamics with either continuous (e.g. independent cascading models) or discontinuous phase transitions (e.g. threshold models). We conclude the review with a summary and an outlook.},

	abstract = {Background: The prevalence of true asymptomatic {COVID}-19 cases is critical to policy makers considering the effectiveness of mitigation measures against the {SARS}-{CoV}-2 pandemic. We aimed to synthesize all available research on the asymptomatic rates and transmission rates where possible. Methods: We searched {PubMed}, Embase, Cochrane {COVID}-19 trials, and Europe {PMC} (which covers pre-print platforms such as {MedRxiv}). We included primary studies reporting on asymptomatic prevalence where: (a) the sample frame includes at-risk population, and (b) there was sufficiently long follow up to identify pre-symptomatic cases. Meta-analysis used fixed effect and random effects models. We assessed risk of bias by combination of questions adapted from risk of bias tools for prevalence and diagnostic accuracy studies. Results: We screened 2,454 articles and included 13 low risk-of-bias studies from seven countries that tested 21,708 at-risk people, of which 663 were positive and 111 were asymptomatic. Diagnosis in all studies was confirmed using a {RT}-{PCR} test. The proportion of asymptomatic cases ranged from 4\% to 41\%. Meta-analysis (fixed effect) found that the proportion of asymptomatic cases was 17\% (95\% {CI}: 14\% - 20\%) overall; higher in aged care 20\% (14\% - 27\%), and lower in non-aged care 16\% (13\% - 20\%). Five studies provided direct evidence of forward transmission of the infection by asymptomatic cases. Overall, there was a 42\% lower relative risk of asymptomatic transmission compared to symptomatic transmission (combined Relative Risk: 0.58; 95\% {CI} 0.335-0.994, p=0.047). Discussion: Our estimates of the prevalence of asymptomatic {COVID}-19 cases and asymptomatic transmission rates are lower than many highly publicized studies, but still sufficient to warrant policy attention. Further robust epidemiological evidence is urgently needed, including in sub-populations such as children, to better understand the importance of asymptomatic cases for driving spread of the pandemic.},

The study also explored the sources of those beliefs. Grade‐12 students in a Canadian urban setting responded, in each of the four modes, to statements from Views on Science‐Technology‐Society. It was discovered that {TV} had far more influence on what students believed about science and its social, technological context than did numerous science courses. The challenge to science educators is to use the media effectively in combating naive views about science. Regarding ambiguity in student assessment, the Likert‐type responses were the most inaccurate, offering only a guess at student beliefs. Such guesswork calls into question the use of Likert‐type standardized tests that claim to assess student views about science. Student paragraph responses contained significant ambiguities in about 50\% of the cases. The empirically developed multiple choices, however, reduced the ambiguity to the 20\% level. Predictably, the semistructured interview was the least ambiguous of all four response modes, but it required the most time to administer. These findings encourage researchers to develop instruments grounded in the empirical data of student viewpoints, rather than relying solely on instruments structured by the philosophical stances of science educators.

By finding such groups of vertices with similar structural roles, we extract a compact representation of the network's large-scale structure, which can facilitate its scientific interpretation and the prediction of unknown or future interactions. Popular approaches, including the stochastic block model ({SBM}), assume edges are unweighted, which limits their utility by discarding potentially useful information. We introduce the weighted stochastic block model ({WSBM}), which generalizes the {SBM} to networks with edge weights drawn from any exponential family distribution. This model learns from both the presence and weight of edges, allowing it to discover structure that would otherwise be hidden when weights are discarded or thresholded. We describe a Bayesian variational algorithm for efficiently approximating this model's posterior distribution over latent block structures. We then evaluate the {WSBM}'s performance on both edge-existence and edge-weight prediction tasks for a set of real-world weighted networks. In all cases, the {WSBM} performs as well or better than the best alternatives on these tasks.},

	abstract = {A principled approach to characterize the hidden structure of networks is to formulate generative models and then infer their parameters from data. When the desired structure is composed of modules or "communities," a suitable choice for this task is the stochastic block model ({SBM}), where nodes are divided into groups, and the placement of edges is conditioned on the group memberships. Here, we present a nonparametric Bayesian method to infer the modular structure of empirical networks, including the number of modules and their hierarchical organization. We focus on a microcanonical variant of the {SBM}, where the structure is imposed via hard constraints, i.e., the generated networks are not allowed to violate the patterns imposed by the model. We show how this simple model variation allows simultaneously for two important improvements over more traditional inference approaches: (1) deeper Bayesian hierarchies, with noninformative priors replaced by sequences of priors and hyperpriors, which not only remove limitations that seriously degrade the inference on large networks but also reveal structures at multiple scales; (2) a very efficient inference algorithm that scales well not only for networks with a large number of nodes and edges but also with an unlimited number of modules. We show also how this approach can be used to sample modular hierarchies from the posterior distribution, as well as to perform model selection. We discuss and analyze the differences between sampling from the posterior and simply finding the single parameter estimate that maximizes it. Furthermore, we expose a direct equivalence between our microcanonical approach and alternative derivations based on the canonical {SBM}.},

	abstract = {In many infectious diseases, an unknown fraction of infections produce symptoms mild enough to go unrecorded, a fact that can seriously compromise the interpretation of epidemiological records. This is true for cholera, a pandemic bacterial disease, where estimates of the ratio of asymptomatic to symptomatic infections have ranged from 3 to 100 (refs 1-5). In the absence of direct evidence, understanding of fundamental aspects of cholera transmission, immunology and control has been based on assumptions about this ratio and about the immunological consequences of inapparent infections. Here we show that a model incorporating high asymptomatic ratio and rapidly waning immunity, with infection both from human and environmental sources, explains 50 yr of mortality data from 26 districts of Bengal, the pathogen's endemic home. We find that the asymptomatic ratio in cholera is far higher than had been previously supposed and that the immunity derived from mild infections wanes much more rapidly than earlier analyses have indicated. We find, too, that the environmental reservoir (free-living pathogen) is directly responsible for relatively few infections but that it may be critical to the disease's endemicity. Our results demonstrate that inapparent infections can hold the key to interpreting the patterns of disease outbreaks. New statistical methods, which allow rigorous maximum likelihood inference based on dynamical models incorporating multiple sources and outcomes of infection, seasonality, process noise, hidden variables and measurement error, make it possible to test more precise hypotheses and obtain unexpected results. Our experience suggests that the confrontation of time-series data with mechanistic models is likely to revise our understanding of the ecology of many infectious diseases. ©2008 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

	abstract = {From the middle 1990s local high density atmospheric motion vectors ({AMVs}) began to be generated from geostationary satellite imagery and to be used operationally in the Australian Bureau of Meteorology. It was soon realised that their benefit to numerical weather prediction ({NWP}) was dependent on quality control, error characterisation and data selection. Here, by comparing the {AMVs} with collocated radiosonde data, we show that quality control ({QC}) considerably reduces vector error. In many cases, {QC} also reduces the correlated error and its associated length scale. Modern operational data assimilation schemes require estimation of observation errors, and they assume either that the errors are uncorrelated or require knowledge of their correlated error and length scale. A new construct, the expected error ({EE}) now employed at the Bureau, has been introduced to assist in quality control and error characterisation of {AMVs}. In this approach each vector is characterised by an expected error value, the correlated error and the related length scale, in addition to the set of currently available error indicators. The expected error allows direct comparison of the accuracy of vectors, based on different image types, or from different producers. At present, comparison of accuracy error is a more difficult process. Provision of the correlated error and length scale permits better use of the vectors in data assimilation, and provides a firm basis for data thinning.},

Despite their widespread occurrence and impact, these events remain largely unpredictable. In searching for the causes for collapse and instability, theoretical investigations have so far been unable to determine quantitatively the influence of the structural features of the network formed by the interacting species. Here, we derive the condition for the stability of a mutualistic ecosystem as a constraint on the strength of the dynamical interactions between species and a topological invariant of the network: the k-core. Our solution predicts that when species located at the maximum k-core of the network go extinct, as a consequence of sufficiently weak interaction strengths, the system will reach the tipping point of its collapse. As a key variable involved in collapse phenomena, monitoring the k-core of the network may prove a powerful method to anticipate catastrophic events in the vast context that stretches from ecological and biological networks to finance.},

Here, we demonstrate that a simple pruning process based on removal of underutilized links and redistribution of loads can lead to the emergence of core-peripheries. Links are assumed beneficial if they either carry a sufficiently large load or are essential for global connectivity. This incentivized redistribution process is controlled by a single parameter, which balances connectivity and profit. The obtained networks exhibit a highly resilient and connected core with a frayed periphery. The balanced network shows a higher resilience than the world airline network or the world trade network, revealing a pathway towards robust structural features through pruning.},

	abstract = {Due to the long-term fluid-solid interactions in waterflooding, the tremendous variation of oil reservoir formation parameters will lead to the widespread evolution of preferential flow paths, thereby preventing the further enhancement of recovery efficiency because of unstable fingering and premature breakthrough. To improve oil recovery, the characterization of preferential flow paths is essential and imperative. In efforts that have been previously documented, fluid flow characteristics within preferential paths are assumed to obey Darcy's equation. However, the occurrence of non-Darcy flow behavior has been increasingly suggested. To examine this conjecture, the Forchheimer number with the inertial coefficient estimated from different empirical formulas is applied as the criterion. Considering a 10\% non-Darcy effect, the fluid flow in a preferential path may do experience non-Darcy behavior. With the objective of characterizing the preferential path with non-Darcy flow, a hybrid analytical/numerical model has been developed to investigate the pressure transient response, which dynamically couples a numerical model describing the non-Darcy effect of a preferential flow path with an analytical reservoir model. The characteristics of the pressure transient behavior and the sensitivities of corresponding parameters have also been discussed. In addition, an interpretation approach for pressure transient testing is also proposed, in which the Gravitational Search Algorithm is employed as a non-linear regression technology to match measured pressure with this hybrid model. Examples of applications from different oilfields are also presented to illustrate this method. This cost-effective approach provides more accurate characterization of a preferential flow path with non-Darcy flow, which will lay a solid foundation for the design and operation of conformance control treatments, as well as several other Enhanced Oil Recovery projects.},

These cracks are found to initiate in the inside of the specimen with quasiperiodic angular distribution. The fragments that are formed when these cracks penetrate the specimen surface give a broad peak in the fragment mass distribution for large fragments that can be fitted by a two-parameter Weibull distribution. This mechanism can only be observed in three-dimensional models or experiments. The results prove to be independent of the degree of disorder in the model.

The microproperties consist of stiffness and strength parameters for the particles and the bonds. Damage is represented explicitly as broken bonds, which form and coalesce into macroscopic fractures when load is applied. The model reproduces many features of rock behavior, including elasticity, fracturing, acoustic emission, damage accumulation producing material anisotropy, hysteresis, dilation, post-peak softening and strength increase with confinement. These behaviors are emergent properties of the model that arise from a relatively simple set of microproperties. A material-genesis procedure and microproperties to represent Lac du Bonnet granite are presented. The behavior of this model is described for two- and three-dimensional biaxial, triaxial and Brazilian tests and for two-dimensional tunnel simulations in which breakout notches form in the region of maximum compressive stress. The sensitivity of the results to microproperties, including particle size, is investigated.

We used real-time mobility data from Wuhan and detailed case data including travel history to elucidate the role of case importation in transmission in cities across China and to ascertain the impact of control measures. Early on, the spatial distribution of {COVID}-19 cases in China was explained well by human mobility data. After the implementation of control measures, this correlation dropped and growth rates became negative in most locations, although shifts in the demographics of reported cases were still indicative of local chains of transmission outside of Wuhan.

Specifically, nationwide, 61.6\% [95\% {CI}: 54.6\%-67.7\%] of reported infections and 55.0\% [95\% {CI}: 46.1\%-62.2\%] of reported deaths as of May 3, 2020 could have been avoided if the same control measures had been implemented just one week earlier. We also examine the effects of delays in re-implementing social distancing following a relaxation of control measures. A longer response time results in a stronger rebound of infections and death. Our findings underscore the importance of early intervention and aggressive response in controlling the {COVID}-19 pandemic.Competing Interest {StatementJS} and Columbia University disclose partial ownership of {SK} Analytics. {JS} discloses consulting for {BNI}.Funding {StatementThis} study was supported by funding from the National Institutes of Health ({GM}110748) and the National Science Foundation ({DMS}-2027369), as well as a gift from the Morris-Singer Foundation.

	abstract = {Background: The first case of {COVID}-19 was detected in Brazil on February 25, 2020. We report the epidemiological, demographic, and clinical findings for confirmed {COVID}-19 cases during the first month of the epidemic in Brazil. Methods: Individual-level and aggregated {COVID}-19 data were analysed to investigate demographic profiles, socioeconomic drivers and age-sex structure of {COVID}-19 tested cases. Basic reproduction numbers (R0) were investigated for Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to identify symptoms associated with confirmed cases and risk factors associated with hospitalization. Laboratory diagnosis for eight respiratory viruses were obtained for 2,429 cases. Findings: By March 25, 1,468 confirmed cases were notified in Brazil, of whom 10\% (147 of 1,468) were hospitalised. Of the cases acquired locally (77.8\%), two thirds (66.9\% of 5,746) were confirmed in private laboratories. Overall, positive association between higher per capita income and {COVID}-19 diagnosis was identified. The median age of detected cases was 39 years ({IQR} 30-53). The median R0 was 2.9 for Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. Cardiovascular disease/hypertension were associated with hospitalization. Co-circulation of six respiratory viruses, including influenza A and B and human rhinovirus was detected in low levels. Interpretation: Socioeconomic disparity determines access to {SARS}-{CoV}-2 testing in Brazil. The lower median age of infection and hospitalization compared to other countries is expected due to a younger population structure. Enhanced surveillance of respiratory pathogens across socioeconomic statuses is essential to better understand and halt {SARS}-{CoV}-2 transmission. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. \#\#\# Funding Statement This work was supported by a {FAPESP} (2018/14389-0) and Medical Research Council and {CADDE} partnership award ({MR}/S0195/1). {NRF} is supported by a Sir Henry Dale Fellowship (204311/Z/16/Z). {WMS} is supported by the São Paulo Research Foundation, Brazil (No. 2017/13981-0). {OJB} was funded by a Sir Henry Wellcome Fellowship funded by the Wellcome Trust (206471/Z/17/Z). {VHN} and {CAP} were supported by {FAPESP} (2018/12579-7). {AEZ} and {BG} are supported by Oxford Martin School. \#\#\# Author Declarations All relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary {IRB} and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the {IRB}/oversight body are included in the manuscript.

This is certainly a challenging situation particularly for countries in a perilous socio-economic situation. With the rapid evolution of the disease, once introduced, making decisions becomes challenging particularly when past experience or data are not so relevant. This is when mathematical models could come handy to predict the evaluations of the epidemic. We designed a modified {SEIR}-type mathematical model which we assessed with up-to-date data of {COVID}-19 cases and deaths around the world, and in which the rate of transmission is derived from the observed delayed fatality rate. We used Brazil as an example for middle income countries and applied our model to the Brazilian context.

Using publicly available event-date data from the ongoing epidemic, the present study investigated the incubation period and other time intervals that govern the epidemiological dynamics of {COVID}-19 infections. Our results show that the incubation period falls within the range of 2–14 days with 95\% confidence and has a mean of around 5 days when approximated using the best-fit lognormal distribution. The mean time from illness onset to hospital admission (for treatment and/or isolation) was estimated at 3–4 days without truncation and at 5–9 days when right truncated. Based on the 95th percentile estimate of the incubation period, we recommend that the length of quarantine should be at least 14 days. The median time delay of 13 days from illness onset to death (17 days with right truncation) should be considered when estimating the {COVID}-19 case fatality risk.},

Methods: We collected dates of illness onset for primary cases (infectors) and secondary cases (infectees) from published research articles and case investigation reports. We subjectively ranked the credibility of the data and performed analyses on both the full dataset (n = 28) and a subset of pairs with highest certainty in reporting (n = 18). In addition, we adjust for right truncation of the data as the epidemic is still in its growth phase. Results: Accounting for right truncation and analyzing all pairs, we estimated the median serial interval at 4.0 days (95\% credible interval [{CrI}]: 3.1, 4.9). Limiting our data to only the most certain pairs, the median serial interval was estimated at 4.6 days (95\% {CrI}: 3.5, 5.9). Conclusions: The serial interval of {COVID}-19 is close to or shorter than its median incubation period. This suggests that a substantial proportion of secondary transmission may occur prior to illness onset. The {COVID}-19 serial interval is also shorter than the serial interval of severe acute respiratory syndrome ({SARS}), indicating that calculations made using the {SARS} serial interval may introduce bias.},

Modelling the structure and evolution of cities is therefore critical because policy makers need robust theories and new paradigms for mitigating these problems. Fortunately, the increased data available about urban systems opens the possibility of constructing a quantitative 'science of cities', with the aim of identifying and modelling essential phenomena. Statistical physics plays a major role in this effort by bringing tools and concepts able to bridge theory and empirical results. This article illustrates this point by focusing on fundamental objects in cities: the distribution of the urban population; segregation phenomena and spin-like models; the polycentric transition of the activity organization; energy considerations about mobility and models inspired by gravity and radiation concepts; {CO}2 emitted by transport; and finally, scaling that describes how various socio-economical and infrastructures evolve when cities grow.},

Here, we analyze a local congestion pricing scheme, hotspot pricing, that surcharges vehicles traversing congested junctions. The proposed tax is computed from the estimation of the evolution of congestion at local level, and the expected response of users to the tax (elasticity). Results on cities’ road networks, considering real-traffic data, show that the proposed hotspot pricing scheme would be more effective than current mechanisms to decongest urban areas, and paves the way towards sustainable congestion in urban areas.},

In particular, we show that the dependence on population size of the total number of miles driven daily, the total length of the road network, the total traffic delay, the total consumption of gasoline, the quantity of {CO}2 emitted and the relation between area and population of cities, are all governed by a single parameter which characterizes the sensitivity to congestion.

It is self-affined and characterized by the roughness exponent of directed polymers χ. For L aν, or on the length scales below the blob size ξ, the path behaves as an optimal path in the strong disorder limit. It has a self-similar fractal shape with fractal dimension dopt.

However, despite its importance in developing congestion mitigation strategies, the understanding of this common traffic phenomenon in a city scale is still missing. An open question is how the traffic in the network collapses from a global efficient traffic to isolated local flows in small clusters, i.e. the question of traffic percolation. Here we study the traffic percolation properties on a lattice by simulation of an agent-based model for traffic. A critical traffic volume in this model distinguishes the free state from the congested state of traffic. Our results show that the threshold of traffic percolation decreases with increasing traffic volume and reaches a minimum value at the critical traffic volume. We show that this minimal threshold is the result of longest spatial correlation between traffic flows at the critical traffic volume.

The growth of complex flow features, such as eddies arising near the fracture surface, was directly associated with changes in surface roughness. Rapid eddy growth above Re values of 1, followed by less rapid growth at higher Re values, suggested a three-zone nonlinear model for flow in rough fractures. This three-zone model, relating effective hydraulic conductivity to Re, was also found to be appropriate for the simulation of water flow in the natural dolomite fracture.

The analysis results suggest a negative correlation between fractal dimension, D, and amplitude, A. Joint roughness coefficients ({JRC}) show a positive correlation with amplitude, A, and a negative correlation with fractal dimension, D. A numerical model of fracture closure is used to investigate the effects of different profile characteristics (D, A and sample size) on the nature of dilation and contact area, using the natural profiles and synthetic fractional Brownian motion profiles. Smooth profiles (low {JRC}, high D, low A) display many small contact regions whereas rough fractures (high {JRC}, low D, high A) display few large contact areas. The agreement with published experimental data supports the suggested correlations between {JRC} and the fractal parameters, A and D. It is suggested that observed scale effects in {JRC} and joint dilation can be explained by small differential strain discontinuities across fractures, which originate at the time of fracture formation. © 1994 Springer-Verlag.},

	abstract = {We simulate high-velocity flow in a self-affine channel with a constant perpendicular opening by solving numerically the Navier-Stokes equations, and analyse the resulting flow qualitatively and quantitatively. At low velocity, i.e. vanishing inertia, the effective permeability is dominated by the narrowest constrictions measured perpendicular to the local flow direction and the flow field tends to fill the channel due to the diffusion generated by the viscous term in the Stokes equation. At high velocity (strong inertia), the high-velocity zones of the flow field resemble a narrow tube of essentially constant thickness in the direction of flow, since the transversal diffusion is weak compared to the longitudinal convection. The thickness of the flow tube decreases with Reynolds number. This narrowing in combination with mass balance results in an average velocity in the flow tube which increases faster with Reynolds number than the average velocity in the fracture. In the low-velocity zones, recirculation zones appear and the pressure is almost constant. The flow tube consists of straight sections. This is due to inertia. The local curvature of the main stream reflects the flow-tube/channel-wall interaction. A boundary layer is formed where the curvature is large. This boundary layer is highly dissipative and governs the large pressure loss (inertial resistance) of the medium. Quantitatively, vanishing, weak and strong inertial flow regimes can be described by the Darcy, weak inertia and Forchheimer flow equations, respectively. We observe a cross-over flow regime from the weak to strong inertia, which extends over a relatively large range of Reynolds numbers.},

Transparent upper and opaque lower walls of these models facilitated the visualization of the flow experiments. Rough surfaces of the model fractures were first digitized. Then, using the gathered data in variogram analysis, surface roughness was quantified by fractal dimension. Another roughness quantification parameter was also handled as the ratio between total fracture surface area and planar surface area. Experimental measurements of flow were quantitatively correlated to surface roughness under different normal loading (aperture) conditions. Also, constant rate immiscible displacement experiments were performed to assess the roughness effect represented by seven different lithologies and wettability effect controlled by the material used in manufacturing the fracture samples on the residual saturation development.},

	abstract = {The present study evaluates aperture distributions and fluid flow characteristics for variously sized laboratory-scale granite fractures under confining stress. As a significant result of the laboratory investigation, the contact area in fracture plane was found to be virtually independent of scale. By combining this characteristic with the self-affine fractal nature of fracture surfaces, a novel method for predicting fracture aperture distributions beyond laboratory scale is developed. Validity of this method is revealed through reproduction of the results of laboratory investigation and the maximum aperture-fracture length relations, which are reported in the literature, for natural fractures. The present study finally predicts conceivable scale dependencies of fluid flows through joints (fractures without shear displacement) and faults (fractures with shear displacement). Both joint and fault aperture distributions are characterized by a scale-independent contact area, a scale-dependent geometric mean, and a scale-independent geometric standard deviation of aperture. The contact areas for joints and faults are approximately 60\% and 40\%. Changes in the geometric means of joint and fault apertures (μm), e m, joint and e m, fault , with fracture length (m), l, are approximated by e m, joint = 1 × 10 2 l 0.1 and e m, fault = 1 × 10 3 l 0.7 , whereas the geometric standard deviations of both joint and fault apertures are approximately 3. Fluid flows through both joints and faults are characterized by formations of preferential flow paths (i.e., channeling flows) with scale-independent flow areas of approximately 10\%, whereas the joint and fault permeabilities (m 2 ), k joint and k fault , are scale dependent and are approximated as k joint = 1 × 10 -12 l 0.2 and k fault = 1 × 10 -8 l 1.1 .},

	volume = {3},
	issn = {0197-7520},
	doi = {10.2118/426-pa},
	abstract = {Abstract An idealized model has been developed for the purpose of studying the characteristic behavior of a permeable medium which contains regions which contribute significantly to the pore volume of the system hut contribute negligibly to the flow capacity; e.g., a naturally fractured or vugular reservoir. Unsteady-state flow in this model reservoir has been investigated analytically. The pressure build-up performance has been examined in some detail; and, a technique for analyzing the build-up data to evaluate the desired parameters has been suggested. The use of this approach in the interpretation of field data has been discussed. As a result of this study, the following general conclusions can be drawn: 1. Two parameters are sufficient to characterize the deviation of the behavior of a medium with "double porosity" from that of a homogeneously porous medium. 2. These parameters can be evaluated by the proper analysis of pressure build-up data obtained from adequately designed tests. 3. Since the build-up curve associated with this type of porous system is similar to that obtained from a stratified reservoir, an unambiguous interpretation is not possible without additional information. 4. Differencing methods which utilize pressure data from the final stages of a build-up test should be used with extreme caution. Introduction In order to plan a sound exploitation program or a successful secondary-recovery project, sufficient reliable information concerning the nature of the reservoir-fluid system must be available. Since it is evident that an adequate description of the reservoir rock is necessary if this condition is to be fulfilled, the present investigation was undertaken for the purpose of improving the fluid-flow characterization, based on normally available data, of a particular porous medium. {DISCUSSION} {OF} {THE} {PROBLEM} For many years it was widely assumed that, for the purpose of making engineering studies, two parameters were sufficient to describe the single-phase flow properties of a producing formation, i.e., the absolute permeability and the effective porosity. It later became evident that the concept of directional permeability was of more than academic interest; consequently, the degree of permeability anisotropy and the orientation of the principal axes of permeability were accepted as basic parameters governing reservoir performance. More recently, it was recognized that at least one additional parameter was required to depict the behavior of a porous system containing regions which contributed significantly to the pore volume but contributed negligibly to the flow capacity. Microscopically, these regions could be "dead-end" or "storage" pores or, macroscopically, they could be discrete volumes of low-permeability matrix rock combined with natural fissures in a reservoir. It is obvious that some provision for the inclusion of all the indicated parameters, as well as their spatial variations, must be made if a truly useful, conceptual model of a reservoir is to be developed. A dichotomy of the internal voids of reservoir rocks has been suggested. These two classes of porosity can be described as follows: a. Primary porosity is intergranular and controlled by deposition and lithification. It is highly interconnected and usually can be correlated with permeability since it is largely dependent on the geometry, size distribution and spatial distribution of the grains. The void systems of sands, sandstones and oolitic limestones are typical of this type. b. Secondary porosity is foramenular and is controlled by fracturing, jointing and/or solution in circulating water although it may be modified by infilling as a result of precipitation. It is not highly interconnected and usually cannot be correlated with permeability. Solution channels or vugular voids developed during weathering or burial in sedimentary basins are indigenous to carbonate rocks such as limestones or dolomites. Joints or fissures which occur in massive, extensive formations composed of shale, siltstone, schist, limestone or dolomite are generally vertical, and they are ascribed to tensional failure during mechanical deformation (the permeability associated with this type of void system is often anisotropic). {SPEJ} P. 245{\textasciicircum}},

One mode of city traffic (during nonrush hours or days off) has similar critical percolation characteristics as small world networks, while the other mode (during rush hours on working days) tends to behave as a 2D lattice. This switching behavior can be understood by the fact that the high-speed urban roads during nonrush hours or days off (that are congested during rush hours) represent effective long-range connections, like in small world networks.

	abstract = {Prediction of traffic congestion is one of the core issues in the realization of smart traffic. Accurate prediction depends on understanding of interactions and correlations between different city locations. While many methods merely consider the spatio-temporal correlation between two locations, here we propose a new approach of capturing the correlation network in a city based on realtime traffic data. We use the weighted degree and the impact distance as the two major measures to identify the most influential locations. A road segment with larger weighted degree or larger impact distance suggests that its traffic flow can strongly influence neighboring road sections driven by the congestion propagation. Using these indices, we find that the statistical properties of the identified correlation network is stable in different time periods during a day, including morning rush hours, evening rush hours, and the afternoon normal time respectively. Our work provides a new framework for assessing interactions between different local traffic flows. The captured correlation network between different locations might facilitate future studies on predicting and controlling the traffic flows.},

In this survey, we review the approaches developed to reproduce various mobility patterns, with the main focus on recent developments. This review can be used both as an introduction to the fundamental modeling principles of human mobility, and as a collection of technical methods applicable to specific mobility-related problems. The review organizes the subject by differentiating between individual and population mobility and also between short-range and long-range mobility.

We find that the major usage of each road segment can be traced to its own-surprisingly few-driver sources. Based on this finding we propose a network of road usage by defining a bipartite network framework, demonstrating that in contrast to traditional approaches, which define road importance solely by topological measures, the role of a road segment depends on both: its betweeness and its degree in the road usage network. Moreover, our ability to pinpoint the few driver sources contributing to the major traffic flow allows us to create a strategy that achieves a significant reduction of the travel time across the entire road system, compared to a benchmark approach.},

In this context, it is important to characterize the collapse of the network, defined as the transition from a characteristic travel time to orders of magnitude longer for the same distance traveled. In this multicity study, we unravel this complex phenomenon under various conditions of demand and translate it to the travel time of the individual drivers. First, we start with the current conditions, showing that there is a characteristic time τ that takes a representative group of commuters to arrive at their destinations once their maximum density has been reached. While this time differs from city to city, it can be explained by Γ, defined as the ratio of the vehicle miles traveled to the total vehicle distance the road network can support per hour. Modifying Γ can improve τ and directly inform planning and infrastructure interventions. In this study we focus on measuring the vulnerability of the system by increasing the volume of cars in the network, keeping the road capacity and the empirical spatial dynamics from origins to destinations unchanged. We identify three states of urban traffic, separated by two distinctive transitions. The first one describes the appearance of the first bottlenecks and the second one the collapse of the system. This collapse is marked by a given number of commuters in each city and it is formally characterized by a nonequilibrium phase transition.},

However, very little attention has been given to the question of how the local flows in the roads are organized collectively into a global city flow. Here we characterize this organization process of traffic as "traffic percolation," where the giant cluster of local flows disintegrates when the second largest cluster reaches its maximum. We find in real-time data of city road traffic that global traffic is dynamically composed of clusters of local flows, which are connected by bottleneck links. This organization evolves during a day with different bottleneck links appearing in different hours, but similar in the same hours in different days. A small improvement of critical bottleneck roads is found to benefit significantly the global traffic, providing a method to improve city traffic with low cost. Our results may provide insights on the relation between traffic dynamics and percolation, which can be useful for efficient transportation, epidemic control, and emergency evacuation.},

We find that, in contrast with the random trajectories predicted by the prevailing Lévy flight and random walk models, human trajectories show a high degree of temporal and spatial regularity, each individual being characterized by a time-independent characteristic travel distance and a significant probability to return to a few highly frequented locations. After correcting for differences in travel distances and the inherent anisotropy of each trajectory, the individual travel patterns collapse into a single spatial probability distribution, indicating that, despite the diversity of their travel history, humans follow simple reproducible patterns.

For any value of p in the interval p c {\textless} p ≤ 1, our results show that the set of bridges has a fractal dimension d {BB} ≈ 1.22 in two dimensions. In the limit p→ 1, a self-similar fracture is revealed as a singly connected line that divides the system in two domains.

	abstract = {The morphology of fractured rock surfaces is studied in terms of their scaling invariance. Fresh brittle fractures of granite and gneiss were sampled with a mechanical laboratory profilometer, and (1+1)-dimensional parallel profiles were added to build actual maps of the surfaces. A first step in the scaling invariance. description is a self-affine analysis using three: independent methods. The root-mean-square and the maximum-minimum difference of the height are shown to follow a power law with the sample length, The return probability anti the Fourier spectrum are also computed. All these approaches converge to a unique self-affine exponent: zeta = 0.80. Analysis over a,broad statistical set provides a reproducibility error of +/-0.05. No significant differences between the isotropic granite and the. markedly anisotropic gneiss appear for the scaling exponents. An analysis of the profilometer shows that the two main drawbacks of the setup are not significant in these analyses. The systematic errors of the scaling analysis are estimated for the, different methods. Isotropy of the scaling invariance within the mean fracture plane is shown either with the result obtained front different fracture orientations or with the two-dimensional Fourier spectrum of the surface topography itself. The analysis is brought further into the multifractal framework. The structure functions are shown to have power law behavior, and their scaling exponent varies nonlinearly with the moment order. Finally, the corresponding conserved process belongs to a universal multifractal class with alpha = 1.5 for the Levy index and C-1 = 0.3 for the fractal codimension of the mean singularities. The three indices (zeta, alpha and C-1) completely characterize the scale invariance. The multifractal behavior is significant for physical properties which depend on high-order moments like contact. According to this study and that of other groups, the self-affine exponent zeta is constant over a large range of scales and for different fracture modes and various materials. This opens the possibility that there exists a form of universality in the cracking process. It appears that only the prefactor of the roughness is dependent on material and mode.},

In aquifers overlying the Marcellus and Utica shale formations of northeastern Pennsylvania and upstate New York, we document systematic evidence for methane contamination of drinking water associated with shalegas extraction. In active gas-extraction areas (one or more gas wells within 1 km), average and maximum methane concentrations in drinking-water wells increased with proximity to the nearest gas well and were 19.2 and 64 mg {CH}4 L-1 (n = 26), a potential explosion hazard; in contrast, dissolved methane samples in neighboring nonextraction sites (no gas wells within 1 km) within similar geologic formations and hydrogeologic regimes averaged only 1.1 {mgL}-1 (P {\textless} 0.05; n = 34). Average δ13C-{CH}4 values of dissolved methane in shallow groundwater were significantly less negative for active than for nonactive sites (-37 ± 7‰ and -54 ± 11‰, respectively; P {\textless} 0.0001). These δ13C-{CH}4 data, coupled with the ratios of methane-to-higher-chain hydrocarbons, and δ2H- {CH}4 values, are consistent with deeper thermogenic methane sources such as the Marcellus and Utica shales at the active sites and matched gas geochemistry from gas wells nearby. In contrast, lower-concentration samples from shallow groundwater at nonactive sites had isotopic signatures reflecting a more biogenic or mixed biogenic/ thermogenic methane source. We found no evidence for contamination of drinking-water samples with deep saline brines or fracturing fluids. We conclude that greater stewardship, data, and - possibly - regulation are needed to ensure the sustainable future of shale-gas extraction and to improve public confidence in its use.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent {MM}- {GBSA} calculations. Using the best {RMSD} among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate ({RMSD} ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide {SP} settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta {FlexPepDock} method (63\% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully.

	abstract = {Localization of deformation during fracture mechanical tests leads to the development of shear bands. We performed triaxial tests using Sidobre granite at four different confining pressures (from 20 to 80 {MPa}). We compared two sets of tests: one set was stopped immediately after the formation of the shear band; a second one included additional shear deformation. From the analysis of thin sections of these laboratory samples, we characterize the typical microstructures in the shear band (mode I and {II} cracks, Riedel cracks, cataclastic flow). Statistical properties of rupture surface roughness and gouge grain size reveals scaling invariance. Using a mechanical profiler, the fracture roughness is measured along parallel profiles and shown to be correctly described over up to 3 orders of magnitude by self-affine geometry with a roughness exponent close to zeta=0.80. This property is very similar to tensile crack even if local processes are different. The influence of the slip is observed. Fracture surfaces are rougher along the slip direction (zeta=0.74) than perpendicular to it (zeta*=0.80). The confining pressure is shown to have a weak effect on the fracture roughness. It smoothes the surface: slight increase of the roughness exponent. Gouge particles extracted from the shear band present a power law distribution with an exponent ranging from 1.44 to 1.91. This exponent appears to increase with the shearing displacement and the confining pressure. When a significant shear of the band is combined with a high confining pressure (i.e., impeded dilation of the band), the hallmark of fragmentation is observed for the particle distribution and related to a smoothing of the band boundary.},

	abstract = {The fracture geometric characteristics ({FGC}) have considerable influence on fluid flow in the fractured rock mass. The present work took experimental approaches to investigate the quantitative relationship between the {FGC} of a rough-walled fracture ({RWF}) and its hydraulic properties, particularly for the deformable fractures subjected to applied stresses. Taking into account the complexity of the {FGC} in realistic practice, the {FGC} studied in this work are comprised of three types: the size of apertures of interconnected void spaces, the contact areas of fracture surfaces, and the heterogeneous distribution of interconnected void spaces. In the proposed mathematical model, the above three {FGC} were represented by the corresponding parameters: the effective mechanical aperture, the contact ratio and the relative fractal dimension, respectively. In the experiment, six single fractured sandstone samples, divided into three groups by different grain sizes, were adopted for high-precision fluid flow tests under a variety of confining stresses. Firstly, to obtain the three-dimensional distribution of fracture morphology for each sample, we proposed a so-called point-cloud data matching method. This method is easy to operate and possesses high spatial resolution accuracy, meanwhile avoiding the destruction of the fracture surfaces. To explore effective percolation networks, the isolated void spaces between the two fracture surfaces, which are surrounded by contact regions and have no contribution to flow seepage, were identified and precluded from whole void spaces. Secondly, for each sample, the variation of the {FGC} representation parameters with confining stresses was quantitatively estimated in the laboratory. Lastly, an improved mathematical model was constructed to represent the relationship between fracture permeability and {FGC} representation parameters for {RWF}, which is also dependent on the confining stress. The theoretical values of hydraulic apertures predicted by our model were in good agreement with the experimental results. These results can account for the effect of the evolution of {FGC} on fracture permeability of deformable {RWF}.},

Both macroscopically homogeneous and heterogeneous rocks are considered. The latter are characterized by large-scale spatial variations and correlations in their effective properties and include rocks that may be characterized by several distinct degrees of porosity, a well-known example of which is a fractured rock with two degrees of porosity-those of the pores and of the fractures. First, the diagenetic processes that give rise to the present reservoir rocks are discussed and a few geometrical models of such processes are described. Then, measurement and characterization of important properties, such as pore-size distribution, pore-space topology, and pore surface roughness, and morphological properties of fracture networks are discussed. It is shown that fractal and percolation concepts play important roles in the characterization of rocks, from the smallest length scale at the pore level to the largest length scales at the fracture and fault scales. Next, various structural models of homogeneous and heterogeneous rock are discussed, and theoretical and computer simulation approaches to flow, dispersion, and displacement in such systems are reviewed. Two different modeling approaches to these phenomena are compared. The first approach is based on the classical equations of transport supplemented with constitutive equations describing the transport and other important coefficients and parameters. These are called the continuum models. The second approach is based on network models of pore space and fractured rocks; it models the phenomena at the smallest scale, a pore or fracture, and then employs large-scale simulation and modern concepts of the statistical physics of disordered systems, such as scaling and universality, to obtain the macroscopic properties of the system. The fundamental roles of the interconnectivity of the rock and its wetting properties in dispersion and two-phase flows, and those of microscopic and macroscopic heterogeneities in miscible displacements are emphasized. Two important conceptual advances for modeling fractured rocks and studying flow phenomena in porous media are also discussed. The first, based on cellular automata, can in principle be used for computing macroscopic properties of flow phenomena in any porous medium, regardless of the complexity of its structure. The second, simulated annealing, borrowed from optimization processes and the statistical mechanics of spin glasses, is used for finding the optimum structure of a fractured reservoir that honors a limited amount of experimental data. © 1993 The American Physical Society.},

A 3D Lattice Boltzmann method ({LBM}) is adopted to predict the flow physics in rock fractures numerically created with and without consideration of the secondary roughness, respectively. The simulation results show that the primary roughness mostly controls the pressure distribution and fracture flow paths at a large scale, whereas the secondary roughness determines the nonlinear properties of the fluid flow at a local scale. As the pressure gradient increases, the secondary roughness enhances the local complexity of velocity distribution by generating and expanding the eddy flow and back flow regions in the vicinity of asperities. It was found that the Forchheimer's law characterizes well the nonlinear flow behavior in fractures of varying roughness. The inertial effects induced by the primary roughness differ only marginally in fractures with the roughness exponent varying from 0.5 to 0.8, and it is the secondary roughness that significantly enhances the nonlinear flow and leads to earlier onset of nonlinearity. Further examined were the effects of surface roughness on the transmissivity, hydraulic aperture and the tortuosity of flow paths, demonstrating again the dominant role of the secondary roughness, especially for the apparent transmissivity and the equivalent hydraulic aperture at high pressure gradient or high Reynolds number. The results may enhance our understanding of the role of surface roughness in the nonlinear flow behaviors in natural rock fractures.},

A series of numerical shear-flow tests under different normal stresses were conducted on rough rock fractures to calculate the evolutions of fracture aperture and permeability. The results show that the rough surfaces of fractal-based fractures can be described using the scaling parameter Hurst exponent (H), in which H = 3-Df, where Df is the fractal dimension of 3D single fractures. The joint roughness coefficient ({JRC}) distribution of fracture profiles follows a Gauss function with a negative linear relationship between H and average {JRC}. The frequency curves of aperture distributions change from sharp to flat with increasing shear displacement, indicating a more anisotropic and heterogeneous flow pattern. Both the mean aperture and permeability of fracture increase with the increment of surface roughness and decrement of normal stress. At the beginning of shear, the permeability increases remarkably and then gradually becomes steady. A predictive model of permeability using the mean mechanical aperture is proposed and the validity is verified by comparisons with the experimental results reported in literature. The proposed model provides a simple method to approximate permeability of fractal-based rough rock fractures during shear using fracture aperture distribution that can be easily obtained from digitized fracture surface information.},

	abstract = {We investigate the validity of applying the 'local cubic law' ({LCL}) to flow in a fracture bounded by impermeable rock surfaces. A two-dimensional order-of-magnitude analysis of the Navier-Stokes equations yields three conditions for the applicability of {LCL} flow, as a leading-order approximation in a local fracture segment with parallel or nonparallel walls. These conditions demonstrate that the 'cubic law' aperture should not be measured on a point-by-point basis but rather as an average over a certain length. Extending to the third dimension, in addition to defining apertures over segment lengths, we find that the geometry of the contact regions influences flow paths more significantly than might be expected from consideration of only the nominal area fraction of these contacts. Moreover, this latter effect is enhanced by the presence of non-{LCL} regions around these contacts. While contact ratios of 0.1-0.2 are usually assumed to have a negligible effect, our calculations suggest that contact ratios as low as 0.03-0.05 can be significant. Analysis of computer-generated fractures with self-affine walls demonstrates a nonlinear increase in contact area and a faster-than-cubic decrease in the overall hydraulic conductivity, with decreasing fracture aperture; these results are in accordance with existing experimental data on flow in fractures. Finally, our analysis of fractures with self-affine walls indicates that the aperture distribution is not lognormal or gamma as is frequently assumed but rather truncated-normal initially and increasingly skewed with fracture closure.},

	abstract = {Using numerical simulations of a simple sea-coast mechanical erosion model, we investigate the effect of spatial long-range correlations in the lithology of coastal landscapes on the fractal behavior of the corresponding coastlines. In the model, the resistance of a coast section to erosion depends on the local lithology configuration as well as on the number of neighboring sea sides. For weak sea forces, the sea is trapped by the coastline and the eroding process stops after some time. For strong sea forces erosion is perpetual. The transition between these two regimes takes place at a critical sea force, characterized by a fractal coastline front. For uncorrelated landscapes, we obtain, at the critical value, a fractal dimension D=1.33, which is consistent with the dimension of the accessible external perimeter of the spanning cluster in two-dimensional percolation. For sea forces above the critical value, our results indicate that the coastline is self-affine and belongs to the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class. In the case of landscapes generated with power-law spatial long-range correlations, the coastline fractal dimension changes continuously with the Hurst exponent H, decreasing from D=1.34 to 1.04, for H=0 and 1, respectively. This nonuniversal behavior is compatible with the multitude of fractal dimensions found for real coastlines. © 2011 American Physical Society.},

To understand the mechanics and transport properties of fluid through a fractured rock in detail and to quantify the sources of non-linearity in the discharge and base pressure relationship, fluid flow experiments were carried out on a cylindrical sample of granite containing a ‘single rough walled fracture’. These experiments were performed under varied conditions of confining pressures, σ{\textless}inf{\textgreater}3{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} (5–40 {MPa}), which can simulate the condition occurring about 1,000 m below in the earth crust, with elevated base pressure, b{\textless}inf{\textgreater}p{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} (up to 25 {MPa}) and by changing fracture roughness. The details of the methodologies involved and the observations are discussed here. The obtained results indicate that most of the data in the Q verses b{\textless}inf{\textgreater}p{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} plot, fall on the straight line and the flow through the single fracture in granite obeys Darcy’s law or the well-known “cubic law” even at high value of b{\textless}inf{\textgreater}p{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} (=4 {MPa}) and σ{\textless}inf{\textgreater}3{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} (=5 {MPa}) combination. The Reynolds number is quite sensitive to the b{\textless}inf{\textgreater}p{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}, σ{\textless}inf{\textgreater}3{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} and fracture roughness, and there is a critical b{\textless}inf{\textgreater}p{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}, beyond which transition in flow occurs from laminar to turbulent. It is believed that such studies will be quite useful in identifying the limits of applicability of well know ‘cubic law’, which is required for precise calculation of discharge and/or aperture in any practical issues and in further improving theoretical/numerical models associated with fluid flow through a single fracture.},

	abstract = {Optimal paths play a fundamental role in numerous physical applications ranging from random polymers to brittle fracture, from the flow through porous media to information propagation. Here for the first time we explore the path that is activated once this optimal path fails and what happens when this new path also fails and so on, until the system is completely disconnected. In fact many applications can also be found for this novel fracture problem. In the limit of strong disorder, our results show that all the cracks are located on a single self-similar connected line of fractal dimension Db 1.22. For weak disorder, the number of cracks spreads all over the entire network before global connectivity is lost. Strikingly, the disconnecting path (backbone) is, however, completely independent on the disorder. © 2009 The American Physical Society.},

	abstract = {The effects of fluid inertia on the pressure drop required to drive fluid flow through periodic and random arrays of aligned cylinders is investigated. Numerical simulations using a lattice-Boltzmann formulation are performed for Reynolds numbers up to about 180. The magnitude of the drag per unit length on cylinders in a square array at moderate Reynolds number is strongly dependent on the orientation of the drag (or pressure gradient) with respect to the axes of the array; this contrasts with Stokes flow through a square array, which is characterized by an isotropic permeability. Transitions to time-oscillatory and chaotically varying flows are observed at critical Reynolds numbers that depend on the orientation of the pressure gradient and the volume fraction. In the limit Re ≪ 1, the mean drag per unit length, F, in both periodic and random arrays, is given by F/(μU) = k1 + k2 Re2, where μ is the fluid viscosity, U is the mean velocity in the bed, and k1 and k2 are functions of the solid volume fraction φ. Theoretical analyses based on point-particle and lubrication approximations are used to determine these coefficients in the limits of small and large concentration, respectively. In random arrays, the drag makes a transition from a quadratic to a linear Re-dependence at Reynolds numbers of between 2 and 5. Thus, the empirical Ergun formula, F/(μU) = c1 + c2 Re, is applicable for Re {\textgreater} 5. We determine the constants c1 and c2 over a wide range of φ. The relative importance of inertia becomes smaller as the volume fraction approaches close packing, because the largest contribution to the dissipation in this limit comes from the viscous lubrication flow in the small gaps between the cylinders.},

	abstract = {Direct Numerical Simulations ({DNS}) of the Navier Stokes equations is an invaluable research tool in fluid dynamics. Still, there are few publicly available research codes and, due to the heavy number crunching implied, available codes are usually written in low-level languages such as C/C++ or Fortran. In this paper we describe a pure scientific Python pseudo-spectral {DNS} code that nearly matches the performance of C++ for thousands of processors and billions of unknowns. We also describe a version optimized through Cython, that is found to match the speed of C++. The solvers are written from scratch in Python, both the mesh, the {MPI} domain decomposition, and the temporal integrators. The solvers have been verified and benchmarked on the Shaheen supercomputer at the {KAUST} supercomputing laboratory, and we are able to show very good scaling up to several thousand cores. A very important part of the implementation is the mesh decomposition (we implement both slab and pencil decompositions) and 3D parallel Fast Fourier Transforms ({FFT}). The mesh decomposition and {FFT} routines have been implemented in Python using serial {FFT} routines (either {NumPy}, {pyFFTW} or any other serial {FFT} module), {NumPy} array manipulations and with {MPI} communications handled by {MPI} for Python (mpi4py). We show how we are able to execute a 3D parallel {FFT} in Python for a slab mesh decomposition using 4 lines of compact Python code, for which the parallel performance on Shaheen is found to be slightly better than similar routines provided through the {FFTW} library. For a pencil mesh decomposition 7 lines of code is required to execute a transform.},

These concepts are illustrated using the linear convection equation, the inviscid Burgers equation, and the two-dimensional Poisson equation. The paper covers finite difference implementation for equations in both conservative and non-conservative form. The paper also includes the development of one-dimensional solver for Euler equations and demonstrate it for the Sod shock tube problem. We show the application of finite difference schemes for developing two-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes solvers with different boundary conditions applied to the lid-driven cavity and vortex-merger problems. At the end of this paper, we develop hybrid Arakawa-spectral solver and pseudo-spectral solver for two-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations.

	abstract = {Two experiments, theoretically motivated by the construction-integration model of com-prehension (W. Kintsch, 1988), investigated effects of prior knowledge on learning from high-and low-coherence history texts. In Experiment 1, participants' comprehension was examined through free recall, multiple-choice questions, and a keyword sorting task. An advantage was found for the high-coherence text on recall and multiple-choice questions. However, high-knowledge readers performed better on the sorting task after reading the low-coherence text. In Experiment 2, participants' comprehension was examined through open-ended questions and the sorting task both immediately and after a 1-week delay. Little effect of delay was found, and the previous sorting task results failed to replicate. As predicted, high-knowledge readers performed better on the open-ended questions after reading the low-coherence text. Reading times from both experiments indicated that the low-coherence text requires more inference processes. These inferences are more likely to be successful and useful for high-knowledge readers. Texts are crucial for conveying and for acquiring new information. Hence, im-proving the quality of instructional texts has been a predominant concern to both researchers and educators. Over the past several decades, a great deal of progress has been made toward identifying methods for achieving this objective. Our approach to this problem has been to examine characteristics of the text as well as of the individual reader, and how these factors affect text comprehension. Here, we will be focusing on effects of readers' background knowledge and text coher-ence, and moreover, the interactive effects of these two factors on memory and learning from instructional texts.},

	abstract = {Understanding the molecular determinants of specificity in protein-protein interaction is an outstanding challenge of postgenome biology. The availability of large protein databases generated from sequences of hundreds of bacterial genomes enables various statistical approaches to this problem. In this context covariance-based methods have been used to identify correlation between amino acid positions in interacting proteins. However, these methods have an important shortcoming, in that they cannot distinguish between directly and indirectly correlated residues. We developed a method that combines covariance analysis with global inference analysis, adopted from use in statistical physics. Applied to a set of {\textgreater}2,500 representatives of the bacterial two-component signal transduction system, the combination of covariance with global inference successfully and robustly identified residue pairs that are proximal in space without resorting to ad hoc tuning parameters, both for heterointeractions between sensor kinase ({SK}) and response regulator ({RR}) proteins and for homointeractions between {RR} proteins. The spectacular success of this approach illustrates the effectiveness of the global inference approach in identifying direct interaction based on sequence information alone. We expect this method to be applicable soon to interaction surfaces between proteins present in only 1 copy per genome as the number of sequenced genomes continues to expand. Use of this method could significantly increase the potential targets for therapeutic intervention, shed light on the mechanism of protein-protein interaction, and establish the foundation for the accurate prediction of interacting protein partners. © 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the {USA}.},

It has long been suggested that the resulting correlations among amino acid compositions at different sequence positions can be exploited to infer spatial contacts within the tertiary protein structure.

Here we develop a computationally efficient implementation of {DCA}, which allows us to evaluate the accuracy of contact prediction by {DCA} for a large number of protein domains, based purely on sequence information. {DCA} is shown to yield a large number of correctly predicted contacts, recapitulating the global structure of the contact map for the majority of the protein domains examined. Furthermore, our analysis captures clear signals beyond intradomain residue contacts, arising, e.g., from alternative protein conformations, ligand-mediated residue couplings, and interdomain interactions in protein oligomers. Our findings suggest that contacts predicted by {DCA} can be used as a reliable guide to facilitate computational predictions of alternative protein conformations, protein complex formation, and even the de novo prediction of protein domain structures, contingent on the existence of a large number of homologous sequences which are being rapidly made available due to advances in genome sequencing.},

Currently most comprehensive models include sequential shifts of visual attention. Here we propose an alternative model of eye movement control, which includes three new principles: spatially distributed lexical processing, a separation of saccade timing from saccade target selection, and autonomous (random) generation of saccades with foveal inhibition. These three features provide a common control mechanism for fixations, refixations, and regressions. Consequently, the model is called {SWIFT} (Saccade-generation with inhibition by foveal targets). Results from numerical simulations are in good agreement with effects of word frequency on single-fixation, first-fixation, and gaze durations as well as fixation and word skipping probabilities in first-pass analysis. The model inherently produces complex eye movement patterns including refixations and regressions due to its underlying dynamical principles. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The major goal of the modeling is to relate cognitive processing (specifically aspects of lexical access) to eye movements in reading. The earliest and simplest versions of the model (E-Z Readers 1 and 2) merely attempt to explain the total time spent on a word before moving forward (the gaze duration) and the probability of fixating a word; later versions (E-Z Readers 3-5) also attempt to explain the durations of individual fixations on individual words and the number of fixations on individual words. The final version (E-Z Reader 5) appears to be psychologically plausible and gives a good account of many phenomena in reading. It is also a good tool for analyzing eye movement data in reading. Limitations of the model and directions for future research are also discussed.},

	abstract = {Recent advances in the technology affording eye movement recordings carry the risk of neglecting past achievements. Without the assistance of this modern armoury, great strides were made in describing the ways the eyes move. For Aristotle the fundamental features of eye movements were binocular, and he described the combined functions of the eyes. This was later given support using simple procedures like placing a finger over the eyelid of the closed eye and culminated in Hering's law of equal innervation. However, the overriding concern in the 19th century was with eye position rather than eye movements. Appreciating discontinuities of eye movements arose from studies of vertigo. The characteristics of nystagmus were recorded before those of saccades and fixations. Eye movements during reading were described by Hering and by Lamare in 1879; both used similar techniques of listening to sounds made during contractions of the extraocular muscles. Photographic records of eye movements during reading were made by Dodge early in the 20th century, and this stimulated research using a wider array of patterns. In the mid-20th century attention shifted to the stability of the eyes during fixation, with the emphasis on involuntary movements. The contributions of pioneers from Aristotle to Yarbus are outlined. © 2010 N J Wade.},

	volume = {109},
	doi = {10.1073/pnas.1120432109/-/DCSupplemental},
	abstract = {Localization of stationary waves occurs in a large variety of vibrating systems, whether mechanical, acoustical, optical, or quantum. It is induced by the presence of an inhomogeneous medium, a complex geometry, or a quenched disorder. One of its most striking and famous manifestations is Anderson localization, responsible for instance for the metal-insulator transition in disordered alloys. Yet, despite an enormous body of related literature, a clear and unified picture of localization is still to be found, as well as the exact relationship between its many manifestations. In this paper, we demonstrate that both Anderson and weak localizations originate from the same universal mechanism, acting on any type of vibration , in any dimension, and for any domain shape. This mechanism partitions the system into weakly coupled subregions. The boundaries of these subregions correspond to the valleys of a hidden landscape that emerges from the interplay between the wave operator and the system geometry. The height of the landscape along its valleys determines the strength of the coupling between the subregions. The landscape and its impact on localization can be determined rigorously by solving one special boundary problem. This theory allows one to predict the localization properties, the confining regions, and to estimate the energy of the vibrational eigenmodes through the properties of one geometrical object. In particular, Anderson localization can be understood as a special case of weak localization in a very rough landscape. vibrations {\textbar} eigenfunctions {\textbar} elliptic operator {\textbar} confinement A puzzling feature exhibited by complex, irregular, or inhomo-geneous systems is their ability to maintain standing waves or vibrations in a very restricted subregion of their domain even in the absence of confining force or potential. The most striking manifestation of this phenomenon is the famous Anderson loca-lization which has fascinated scientists and spurred an extraordinarily abundant wealth of literature in the past 50 years (1-6). Since Anderson's seminal work in 1958 it is known that a sufficiently large structural disorder can lead to strongly localized quantum states, which are standing waves of the Schrödinger equation. This phenomenon has now been experimentally demonstrated in optic or electromagnetic systems (7-9). Another well-known example of vibration confinement is the weak localization occurring in domains of irregular geometry and characterized by a slow decay of the vibration amplitude away from its main existence subregion (10-13), as opposed to the exponential decay of Anderson localization. Considerable progress has been made to understand the onset of weak and Anderson localization, as well as the possible link between these two types of localization (14). Even though a few approaches statistically relate the energy levels to the potential in disordered solids (15, 16), there has been no general theory able to directly determine for any domain and any type of inhomo-geneity the precise relationship between the geometry of the domain , the nature of the disorder, and the localization of vibrations , to predict in which subregions one can expect localized standing waves to appear, and in which frequency range. Consider for instance a simple case of Anderson localization illustrated in Fig. 1. The original domain (called Ω) is a unit square. It is divided into 400 ¼ 20 × 20 smaller squares. On each of these smaller squares, the potential V ð {\textasciitilde}{xÞ} is constant, its value being determined at random uniformly between 0 and V max (here V max ¼ 8;000, see Fig. 1, Left). We compute the quantum states, i.e., the eigenmodes ψ and the energy levels E of the Hamiltonian H ¼ −Δ þ V (the arbitrary energy units are taken such that ℏ 2 ∕2m ¼ 1). These quantum states obey the stationary Schrödin-ger equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions [Anderson's original paper used a tight-binding model which can be seen as the discrete projection of a continuous Hamiltonian, both converging toward the white noise potential in the limit of small lattice parameter (2)], as follows: ð−Δ þ V Þψ ¼ Eψ in Ω; ψj ∂Ω ¼ 0. [1] The five quantum states of lowest energy are plotted together in Fig. 1, Right. It appears that one cannot directly deduce the detailed shape of the localized quantum states, i.e., the boundary of the subregion that contains most of the mode energy, from the shape of the potential itself. Normally, one would have to solve the eigenvalue problem to retrieve this information. In the present paper, we introduce a fundamentally unique theory that determines the localization subregions from the knowledge of the disordered potential itself. Unifying weak and Anderson localization within the same mathematical framework, the proposed theory reveals inside any vibrating system a hidden landscape that divides the original domain into several weakly coupled vibrating subregions. It unravels the relationship between the geometry of these localization subregions and the mode energy, and finally predicts the critical energy above which one can expect fully delocalized, i.e., conducting states to appear. Results The Landscape of Localization. The essential step in our approach consists in solving not the eigenvalue problem, but the Dirichlet problem with uniform right-hand side and Dirichlet boundary conditions, as follows: ð−Δ þ V Þu ¼ 1 with uj ∂Ω ¼ 0. [2] The Hamiltonian H ¼ −Δ þ V is a second-order elliptic operator with variable coefficients, which is positive if V ð {\textasciitilde}{xÞ} is positive everywhere. In this case the solution u is a positive function, and its map can be considered as a landscape (see Fig. 2, Left)},

	abstract = {The usual theories of electrical conductivity suffer from a number of weaknesses. This paper attempts, on the basis of a simple model, to put the theory on as rigorous a basis as possible. A technique is developed which gives the entire density matrix of the system of charge carriers in the steady state. Our model consists of noninteracting free (or Bloch) electrons being scattered by "random" rigid impurity centers. The density matrix is developed in ascending powers of the strength of the scattering potential. The familiar Boltzmann transport equation represents an approximation valid in the limiting cases of very weak or very dilute scat-terers. Higher order corrections are given. L {INTRODUCTION} " 'N this paper we shall be concerned with the problem {\textasciitilde} {\textasciitilde} of calculating the electrical conductivity of a somewhat simplified model of a real substance, on as rigorous a basis as possible. The problem of electrical conductivity is usually treated on the basis of a transport eqlafion. ' This is an equation for a distribution function f, which describes the probability of a particle being in any given state. The equation is determined by the requirement that in the steady state the total rate of change of the distribution function must vanish. This is in turn a sum of the change due to the acceleration by the electric Geld, and a term due to collisions, which limit this acceleration. Thus the usual transport equation has the form ({\textasciitilde}fl{\textasciitilde}t) field+ ({\textasciitilde}fir)t) coilisions Equation (1) is incomplete in several respects. First, it is well known that in quantum mechanics if we wish to find the average of a physical quantity we need in general not only the probabilities of diferent states being occupied, but the entire density matrix (see below). Now the occupation probabilities of some complete set of states are just the diagonal elements of the density matrix in this representation. Therefore for (1) to contain all necessary information we have to assume that we can And a "natural representation" for our system, and that for this representation the density matrix may be considered as diagonal at all times. This so-called "random phase" assumption must also be made in the derivation of (1), and is a serious weakness of the derivation. Further, it is not always clear just what "natural representation" should be chosen, and one can obtain diferent answers by making diferent choices. 2 Recently considerable progress in the question of removing this random-phase assumption has been made by Van Hove, ' who studied the question of the approach to equilibrium rather than the steady state in the presence of an external electric Geld. He was able to show that the random-phase assumption could be replaced by certain properties of the interaction causing collisions , and that these properties could be verified in particular problems. The method we shall use to avoid the random-phase assumption is formally rather different from that of Van Hove but rests, very likely, on similar properties of the interaction. Another weakness of Eq. (1) in its usual form is that it treats the collision interaction by the lowest order of perturbation theory. The question of what exactly occurs in higher order seems never to have been investigated carefully. We shall extend the theory in this direction also, and show that in the higher orders terms of the usual form appear but, in addition, there are some characteristic deviations from the standard transport equation. Some of these new terms would seem to play a role in the theory of the Hall {eGect} in ferromagnetic substances. ' The general technique is the following. We shall imagine a closed system in the presence of an external electric field which is gradually being turned on. The sample is taken to be cubical in shape and periodic boundary conditions are imposed. These boundary conditions allow the existence of a steady current and are justified in detail in Appendix A. The density matrix of this system then has a well-dehned equation of motion. We study this density matrix for a given electric Geld in the limit where the rate of turning on becomes * Diferent portions of this work were performed at 2 This situation arises in practice when considering the problem of the Hall effect in ferromagnetic substances. Differing results were obtained by R. Karplus and J. M. Luttinger {LPhys}. Rev. 95, 1154 (1954)g and J. Smit {LPhysica} 21, 1 (1955) j, with different assumptions. In fact, the desire to settle this controversy was the starting point of this paper. We hope to return to the application of our results to the Hall effect question in a later publication. s L.

This paper presents a simple model for such processes as spin diffusion or conduction in the "impurity band. " These processes involve transport in a lattice which is in some sense random, and in them diffusion is expected to take place via quantum jumps between localized sites. In this simple model the essential randomness is introduced by requiring the energy to vary randomly from site to site. It is shown that at low enough densities no diffusion at all can take place, and the criteria for transport to occur are given.},

Coarse-grained equations of motion have been recently presented in the literature.

The theoretical progress has highlighted the presence of intrinsic length-scales that invalidate scale invariance often assumed to be present in kinetic roughening processes such as that of a two-phase boundary in liquid penetration. Another important fact is that the macroscopic fluid flow, the kinetic roughening properties, and the effective noise in the problem are all coupled. Many possible deviations from simple scaling behaviour exist, and we outline the experimental evidence. Finally, prospects for further work, both theoretical and experimental, are discussed.},

Such a filtering can be tuned up to any desired level by controlling the genus of the resulting graph. We show that this technique is especially suitable for correlation-based graphs, giving filtered graphs that preserve the hierarchical organization of the minimum spanning tree but containing a larger amount of information in their internal structure. In particular in the case of planar filtered graphs (genus equal to 0), triangular loops and four-element cliques are formed. The application of this filtering procedure to 100 stocks in the U.S. equity markets shows that such loops and cliques have important and significant relationships with the market structure and properties. cluster analysis complex networks correlation analysis},

Variation in individual susceptibility or exposure to infection exacerbates this effect. Individuals that are more susceptible or more exposed tend to be infected earlier, depleting the susceptible 25 subpopulation of those who are at higher risk of infection. This selective depletion of susceptibles intensifies the deceleration in incidence. Eventually, susceptible numbers become low enough to prevent epidemic growth or, in other words, the herd immunity threshold ({HIT}) is reached. Although estimates vary, simple calculations suggest that herd immunity to {SARS}-{CoV}-2 requires 60-70\% of the population to be immune. By fitting epidemiological models that 30 allow for heterogeneity to {SARS}-{CoV}-2 outbreaks across the globe, we show that variation in susceptibility or exposure to infection reduces these estimates.

The classical {SIR} model is one of the simplest compartmental models of contagion spread, assuming a single shared susceptibility level. However, variation in susceptibility over a population can fundamentally affect the dynamics of contagion and thus the ultimate outcome of a pandemic. We develop mathematical machinery which explicitly considers susceptibility variation, illuminates how the susceptibility distribution is sculpted by contagion, and thence how such variation affects the {SIR} differential questions that govern contagion. Our methods allow us to derive closed form expressions for herd immunity thresholds as a function of initial susceptibility distributions and suggests an intuitively satisfying approach to inoculation when only a fraction of the population is accessible to such intervention. Of particular interest, if we assume static susceptibility of individuals in the susceptible pool, ignoring susceptibility diversity \{{\textbackslash}em always\} results in overestimation of the herd immunity threshold and that difference can be dramatic.

All the Lyapunov exponents are calculated for several values of viscosity, and they are found to have a scaling property in the interior of the attractor. The calculated distribution function of the Lyapunov exponents appear to have a singularity at null Lyapunov exponent. {PACS} numbers: 05.45.+b, 47.25.Cg Properties of fully developed turbulence still lack an appropriate interpretation in the strange-attractor theory in spite of recent advances in the theory of dynamical systems. In particular, the scaling property in the inertial range has not yet been understood as any characteristic of such a strange attractor, mostly because numerical techniques developed so far are not sufficiently powerful for high-dimensional attractors of partial differential equations because of {insufFicient} ability of present computers. At the present stage, therefore, one of the possible strategies is to investigate in detail a chaotic dynami-cal system which has a scaling property similar to that in real fluid turbulence but is tractable in size. In this direction Grappin and co-workers' investigated a model equation of {MHD} turbulence, in which both the Kaplan-Yorke dimension of the attractor and the time-averaged kinetic and magnetic spectra are compatible with Kolmogorov's scaling law for fluid turbulence. In this Letter we focus our attention on what type of strange attractor can be connected with the scaling law of turbulence. We investigate a model equation of two-dimensional (2D) turbulence of ordinary fluid which was first proposed by Gledzer.

Each evolution equation for u" is assumed to be quadratically nonlinear and connected with the two preceding and the two succeeding equations. Moreover, the conservation of phase volume +"Bu"/Bu"=0 is also assumed to hold in the inviscid unforced case, where the dot denotes the time derivative.

It is found that energy propagates through the inertial range intermittently like bursts which are separated by quiescent periods (Siggia's view revisited). During the activated phase the first local Lyapunov exponent oscillates violently, and the support of the first Lyapunov vector spreads over the inertial subrange. § 1. Introduction Various turbulent phenomena observed in diverse fields of nonlinear physics have their origin in strange attractors in the phase space\_ One of the most important examples of such phenomena is fully-developed three-dimensional (3D) turbulence governed by the N avier-Stokes equation, where the phase space is an infinite dimensional function space and the strange attract or has a huge dimension\_ Since its discovery, the concept of the strange attractor has been expected to give a unified approach to the turbulent phenomena.!) However, up to now, the notion of the strange attractor is useful mainly for lower-dimensional turbulent motions, and has not yet given a satisfactory understanding of fully-developed turbulence. Particularly , no interpretation is found for the fundamental scaling law of Kolmogorov in the theory2) of chaotic dynamical systems. This is firstly because the fully-developed turbulence has much more degrees of freedom than the present-day supercomputers can reasonably deal with, and secondly because most of the charatterizations of strange attractors devised so far are practically applicable to systems with small degrees of freedom. At present, at least from a numerical point of view, the fully-developed turbulence seems to be still beyond the approach of the methods in the dynamical system theory. Recently, a certain class of cascade models of turbulence has been proposed to fill in this gap. The cascade model of this kind has a tractable dimension, and shares some fundamental aspects with fully-developed 3D Navier-Stokes turbulence; especially it has the Kolmogorov scaling property (K41) of the temporally averaged energy spectrum in its chaotic state. It is, therefore, of some interest to examine this tractable model in detail by the methods in the dynamical system theory. In previous papers 3),4) we discussed the scaling properties of both the energy spectrum and the Lyapunov exponents in the cascade models. (These results are summarized in the following section.) What we were concerned there with were temporally averaged properties, for example, the mean model energy in wavenumber space and the mean},

	abstract = {High-resolution direct numerical simulations of isotropic homogeneous turbulence are used to understand the differences between the effects of spatial intermittency on the energy dissipation rate and on surrogates for the dissipation rate that are based on measurements of a subset of the strain rate tensor. In particular, the one-dimensional longitudinal and transverse surrogates, as well as a surrogate based on the asymmetric part of the strain rate tensor, are considered. The instantaneous surrogates are studied locally, locally averaged in space and conditionally averaged to see what statistics of the dissipation rate might accurately be inferred given measurements of the surrogates. The simulations with the Reynolds numbers based on the Taylor microscale of 102-235 are highly resolved for accurate evaluation of higher-order statistics. The probability densities of the local and locally averaged surrogates are significantly different from the corresponding statistics for the dissipation rate itself. All of the surrogates are more intermittent than the dissipation rate, the transverse surrogate is more intermittent than the longitudinal and these trends are still prominent even when the fields are spatially averaged at length scales close to the integral length scale. As a consequence, the intermittency exponent computed from the moments of the locally averaged longitudinal and transverse surrogates is approximately 1.5 and 2.2 times higher, respectively, than that computed by the same method from the dissipation rate field. In addition, while different methods of computing intermittency exponent from the dissipation rate field yield the same result, different methods applied to a surrogate are inconsistent. © 2012 Cambridge University Press.},

Using confocal microscopy, we directly visualize this process in situ and thereby identify the fundamental mechanisms by which particles are distributed throughout a medium. At high injection pressures, hydrodynamic stresses cause particles to be continually deposited on and eroded from the solid matrix-notably, forcing them to be distributed throughout the entire medium. By contrast, at low injection pressures, the relative influence of erosion is suppressed, causing particles to localize near the inlet of the medium. Unexpectedly, these macroscopic distribution behaviors depend on imposed pressure in similar ways for particles of different charges, although the pore-scale distribution of deposi-tion is sensitive to particle charge. These results reveal how the multiscale interactions between fluid, particles, and the solid matrix control how colloids are distributed in a porous medium.},

We propose a number of measures of assortative mixing appropriate to the various mixing types, and apply them to a variety of real-world networks, showing that assortative mixing is a pervasive phenomenon found in many networks. We also propose several models of assortatively mixed networks, both analytic ones based on generating function methods, and numerical ones based on Monte Carlo graph generation techniques.

	abstract = {It is shown that vibrated packings of frictional disks self-organize cooperatively onto a rotational-transport state where the long-time angular velocity ω¯i of each disk i is nonzero. Steady rotation is mediated by the spontaneous breaking of local reflection symmetry, arising when the cages in which disks are constrained by their neighbors acquire quenched disorder at large packing densities. Experiments and numerical simulation of this unexpected phenomenon show excellent agreement with each other, revealing two rotational phases as a function of excitation intensity, respectively, the low-drive ({LDR}) and the moderate-drive ({MDR}) regimes. In the {LDR}, interdisk contacts are persistent and rotation happens due to frictional sliding. In the {MDR}, disks bounce against each other, still forming a solid phase. In the {LDR}, simple energy-dissipation arguments are provided, that support the observed dependence of the typical rotational velocity on excitation strength.},

It can benefit a variety of downstream tasks such as {KG} completion and relation extraction, and hence has quickly gained massive attention. In this article, we provide a systematic review of existing techniques, including not only the state-of-The-Arts but also those with latest trends. Particularly, we make the review based on the type of information used in the embedding task. Techniques that conduct embedding using only facts observed in the {KG} are first introduced. We describe the overall framework, specific model design, typical training procedures, as well as pros and cons of such techniques. After that, we discuss techniques that further incorporate additional information besides facts. We focus specifically on the use of entity types, relation paths, textual descriptions, and logical rules. Finally, we briefly introduce how {KG} embedding can be applied to and benefit a wide variety of downstream tasks such as {KG} completion, relation extraction, question answering, and so forth.},

	abstract = {The Revealed Comparative Advantage ({RCA}) index is an important metric for evaluating competitiveness of a country in exporting certain commodity. While it is desirable to have a normally distributed {RCA} index, the opposite is often found in empirical studies, and efforts for developing alternative indices of the {RCA} index have not been very successful. This motivates us to ask a more fundamental question: what is the significance of a normally distributed {RCA} index? To answer this question, we have defined a quantity called the Deviation from Gaussianity ({DfG}) based on the {KS} test, which quantifies the deviation of the distribution of a country’s {RCA} index from normality. By systematically analyzing the distribution characteristics of {RCA} index for each country from 1991 to 2019, we find that {DfG} is strongly negatively correlated with the logarithm of {GDP} and the Economic Complexity Index ({ECI}). In particular, correlation between {DfG} and {GDP} is stronger than that between {ECI} and {GDP} since 2008. These results suggest that {DfG} may serve as a new excellent index to quantify the economic complexity and economic performance of a country.},

	abstract = {Many real-world networks are so large that we must simplify their structure before we can extract useful information about the systems they represent. As the tools for doing these simplifications proliferate within the network literature, researchers would benefit from some guidelines about which of the so-called community detection algorithms are most appropriate for the structures they are studying and the questions they are asking. Here we show that different methods highlight different aspects of a network's structure and that the the sort of information that we seek to extract about the system must guide us in our decision. For example, many community detection algorithms, including the popular modularity maximization approach, infer module assignments from an underlying model of the network formation process. However, we are not always as interested in how a system's network structure was formed, as we are in how a network's extant structure influences the system's behavior. To see how structure influences current behavior, we will recognize that links in a network induce movement across the network and result in system-wide interdependence. In doing so, we explicitly acknowledge that most networks carry flow. To highlight and simplify the network structure with respect to this flow, we use the map equation. We present an intuitive derivation of this flow-based and information-theoretic method and provide an interactive on-line application that anyone can use to explore the mechanics of the map equation. We also describe an algorithm and provide source code to efficiently decompose large weighted and directed networks based on the map equation.},

We give a comprehensive treatment of different kinds of edge weights (i.e., continuous or discrete, signed or unsigned, bounded or unbounded), as well as arbitrary weight transformations, and describe an unsupervised model selection approach to choose the best network description. We illustrate the application of our method to a variety of empirical weighted networks, such as global migrations, voting patterns in congress, and neural connections in the human brain.},

	abstract = {Many complex systems display a surprising degree of tolerance against errors. For example, relatively simple organisms grow, persist and reproduce despite drastic pharmaceutical or environmental interventions, an error tolerance attributed to the robustness of the underlying metabolic network1. Complex communication networks2 display a surprising degree of robustness: although key components regularly malfunction, local failures rarely lead to the loss of the global information-carrying ability of the network. The stability of these and other complex systems is often attributed to the redundant wiring of the functional web defined by the systems' components. Here we demonstrate that error tolerance is not shared by all redundant systems: it is displayed only by a class of inhomogeneously wired networks, called scale-free networks, which include the World-Wide Web3,4,5, the Internet6, social networks7 and cells8. We find that such networks display an unexpected degree of robustness, the ability of their nodes to communicate being unaffected even by unrealistically high failure rates. However, error tolerance comes at a high price in that these networks are extremely vulnerable to attacks (that is, to the selection and removal of a few nodes that play a vital role in maintaining the network's connectivity). Such error tolerance and attack vulnerability are generic properties of communication networks.},

By using this strategy we develop a general visualization algorithm that can be used to compare the structural properties of various networks and highlight their hierarchical structure. The low computational complexity of the algorithm, O(n + e), where n is the size of the network, and e is the number of edges, makes it suitable for the visualization of very large sparse networks.

	doi = {10.1038/nature04153},
	abstract = {Population-level analyses often use average quantities to describe heterogeneous systems, particularly when variation does not arise from identifiable groups. A prominent example, central to our current understanding of epidemic spread, is the basic reproductive number, R0, which is defined as the mean number of infections caused by an infected individual in a susceptible population. Population estimates of R0 can obscure considerable individual variation in infectiousness, as highlighted during the global emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome ({SARS}) by numerous 'superspreading events' in which certain individuals infected unusually large numbers of secondary cases. For diseases transmitted by non-sexual direct contacts, such as {SARS} or smallpox, individual variation is difficult to measure empirically, and thus its importance for outbreak dynamics has been unclear. Here we present an integrated theoretical and statistical analysis of the influence of individual variation in infectiousness on disease emergence. Using contact tracing data from eight directly transmitted diseases, we show that the distribution of individual infectiousness around R0 is often highly skewed. Model predictions accounting for this variation differ sharply from average-based approaches, with disease extinction more likely and outbreaks rarer but more explosive. Using these models, we explore implications for outbreak control, showing that individual-specific control measures outperform population-wide measures. Moreover, the dramatic improvements achieved through targeted control policies emphasize the need to identify predictive correlates of higher infectiousness. Our findings indicate that superspreading is a normal feature of disease spread, and to frame ongoing discussion we propose a rigorous definition for superspreading events and a method to predict their frequency. © 2005 Nature Publishing Group.},

	abstract = {The whole frame of interconnections in complex networks hinges on a specific set of structural nodes, much smaller than the total size, which, if activated, would cause the spread of information to the whole network, or, if immunized, would prevent the diffusion of a large scale epidemic. Localizing this optimal, that is, minimal, set of structural nodes, called influencers, is one of the most important problems in network science. Despite the vast use of heuristic strategies to identify influential spreaders, the problem remains unsolved. Here we map the problem onto optimal percolation in random networks to identify the minimal set of influencers, which arises by minimizing the energy of a many-body system, where the form of the interactions is fixed by the non-backtracking matrix of the network. Big data analyses reveal that the set of optimal influencers is much smaller than the one predicted by previous heuristic centralities. Remarkably, a large number of previously neglected weakly connected nodes emerges among the optimal influencers. These are topologically tagged as low-degree nodes surrounded by hierarchical coronas of hubs, and are uncovered only through the optimal collective interplay of all the influencers in the network. The present theoretical framework may hold a larger degree of universality, being applicable to other hard optimization problems exhibiting a continuous transition from a known phase.},

Performing this pruning for the sequence of natural numbers k, we decompose the network into a hierarchy of progressively nested Gk-cores. We present an analytical framework for description of Gk-core percolation for undirected uncorrelated networks with arbitrary degree distributions (configuration model). To confirm our results, we also derive rate equations for the k-leaf removal algorithm which enable us to obtain the structural characteristics of the Gk-cores in another way.

	abstract = {Understanding how severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ({SARS}-{CoV}-2) emerged in 2019 is critical to preventing future zoonotic outbreaks before they become the next pandemic. The Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, China, was identified as a likely source of cases in early reports, but later this conclusion became controversial. We show here that the earliest known {COVID}-19 cases from December 2019, including those without reported direct links, were geographically centered on this market. We report that live {SARS}-{CoV}-2?susceptible mammals were sold at the market in late 2019 and that within the market, {SARS}-{CoV}-2?positive environmental samples were spatially associated with vendors selling live mammals. Although there is insufficient evidence to define upstream events, and exact circumstances remain obscure, our analyses indicate that the emergence of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 occurred through the live wildlife trade in China and show that the Huanan market was the epicenter of the {COVID}-19 pandemic. As 2019 turned into 2020, a coronavirus spilled over from wild animals into people, sparking what has become one of the best documented pandemics to afflict humans. However, the origins of the pandemic in December 2019 are controversial. Worobey et al. amassed the variety of evidence from the City of Wuhan, China, where the first human infections were reported. These reports confirm that most of the earliest human cases centered around the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. Within the market, the data statistically located the earliest human cases to one section where vendors of live wild animals congregated and where virus-positive environmental samples concentrated. In a related report, Pekar et al. found that genomic diversity before February 2020 comprised two distinct viral lineages, A and B, which were the result of at least two separate cross-species transmission events into humans (see the Perspective by Jiang and Wang). The precise events surrounding virus spillover will always be clouded, but all of the circumstantial evidence so far points to more than one zoonotic event occurring in Huanan market in Wuhan, China, likely during November?December 2019. ?{CA} Spatial distributions of early cases and environmental samples show that {SARS}-{CoV}-2 emergence was associated with the wildlife trade.},

Here we analyse the determinants of cross-class interaction using data from Facebook, building on the analysis in our companion paper7. We show that about half of the social disconnection across socioeconomic lines—measured as the difference in the share of high-socioeconomic status ({SES}) friends between people with low and high {SES}—is explained by differences in exposure to people with high {SES} in groups such as schools and religious organizations. The other half is explained by friending bias—the tendency for people with low {SES} to befriend people with high {SES} at lower rates even conditional on exposure. Friending bias is shaped by the structure of the groups in which people interact. For example, friending bias is higher in larger and more diverse groups and lower in religious organizations than in schools and workplaces. Distinguishing exposure from friending bias is helpful for identifying interventions to increase cross-{SES} friendships (economic connectedness). Using fluctuations in the share of students with high {SES} across high school cohorts, we show that increases in high-{SES} exposure lead low-{SES} people to form more friendships with high-{SES} people in schools that exhibit low levels of friending bias. Thus, socioeconomic integration can increase economic connectedness in communities in which friending bias is low. By contrast, when friending bias is high, increasing cross-{SES} interactions among existing members may be necessary to increase economic connectedness. To support such efforts, we release privacy-protected statistics on economic connectedness, exposure and friending bias for each {ZIP} (postal) code, high school and college in the United States at https://www.socialcapital.org.},

To understand the reasons behind these failures we analyze the raw data of a trusted pollster which failed to predict, along with the rest of the pollsters, the surprising 2019 presidential election in Argentina. Analysis of the raw and re-weighted data from longitudinal surveys performed before and after the elections reveals clear biases related to mis-representation of the population and, most importantly, to social-desirability biases, i.e., the tendency of respondents to hide their intention to vote for controversial candidates. We propose an opinion tracking method based on machine learning models and big-data analytics from social networks that overcomes the limits of traditional polls. This method includes three prediction models based on the loyalty classes of users to candidates, homophily measures and re-weighting scenarios. The model achieves accurate results in the 2019 Argentina elections predicting the overwhelming victory of the candidate Alberto Fernández over the incumbent president Mauricio Macri, while none of the traditional pollsters was able to predict the large gap between them. Beyond predicting political elections, the framework we propose is more general and can be used to discover trends in society, for instance, what people think about economics, education or climate change.},

	abstract = {Social capital—the strength of an individual’s social network and community—has been identified as a potential determinant of outcomes ranging from education to health1–8. However, efforts to understand what types of social capital matter for these outcomes have been hindered by a lack of social network data. Here, in the first of a pair of papers9, we use data on 21 billion friendships from Facebook to study social capital. We measure and analyse three types of social capital by {ZIP} (postal) code in the United States: (1) connectedness between different types of people, such as those with low versus high socioeconomic status ({SES}); (2) social cohesion, such as the extent of cliques in friendship networks; and (3) civic engagement, such as rates of volunteering. These measures vary substantially across areas, but are not highly correlated with each other. We demonstrate the importance of distinguishing these forms of social capital by analysing their associations with economic mobility across areas. The share of high-{SES} friends among individuals with low {SES}—which we term economic connectedness—is among the strongest predictors of upward income mobility identified to date10,11. Other social capital measures are not strongly associated with economic mobility. If children with low-{SES} parents were to grow up in counties with economic connectedness comparable to that of the average child with high-{SES} parents, their incomes in adulthood would increase by 20\% on average. Differences in economic connectedness can explain well-known relationships between upward income mobility and racial segregation, poverty rates, and inequality12–14. To support further research and policy interventions, we publicly release privacy-protected statistics on social capital by {ZIP} code at https://www.socialcapital.org.},

	abstract = {The recent advances in 3-D imaging of porous structures have generated a tremendous interest in the simulation of complex single and two-phase flows. Lattice-Boltzmann ({LB}) schemes present a powerful tool to solve the flow field directly from the binarized 3-D images. However, as viscosity often plays an important role, the {LB} scheme should correctly treat viscosity effects. This is the case using a {LB} scheme with two relaxation times ({TRT}) unlike the broadly used, the single-relaxation rate, {BGK}, where the velocity of the modeled fluid does not vary as the inverse of the viscosity applying the bounce-back (no-slip) boundary rule. The aim of this work is to apply the {LB}-{TRT} approach to different types of porous media (straight channels, 2-D model porous media, sandstone) to solve for the flow field and to evaluate the approach in terms of parameter dependence, error and convergence time on the basis of permeability. We show that the variation of permeability with the free relaxation parameter ? of the {TRT} scheme depends on the heterogeneity of the sample and on the numerical resolution. The convergence time depends on the applied viscosity and the parameter standing for the speed of sound, thus the computation time can be reduced by choosing appropriate values of those parameters. Two approaches to calculate permeability (Darcy's law and viscous energy dissipation) are proposed and investigated. We recommend to use Darcy's law, as dependence on ? is less important. Periodic (in the presence of a driving body force) and pressure boundary conditions are evaluated in terms of the results.},

While the flux is increased linearly, the evolution of porosity is observed to be intermittent with erosion occurring at the boundaries between low and high porosity regions. Calculating the spatial distribution of the flow within the medium and the fluid stress given by the product of the fluid flux and the volume fraction of the particles, we find that the system organizes itself to be locally near the threshold needed to Erode the weakest particles. A statistical model simulating the coupling of the erosion, transport, and deposition of the particles to the local fluid flow and porosity is found to capture the overall development of the observed channels.},

	abstract = {Flow through a saturated, granular, porous medium can lead to internal erosion, preferential flow enhancement, and the formation of channels within the bulk of the medium. We examine this phenomenon using a combination of experimental observations, continuum theory and numerical simulations in a minimal setting. Our experiments are carried out by forcing water through a Hele-Shaw cell packed with bidisperse grains. When the local flow-induced stress exceeds a critical threshold, the smaller grains are dislodged and transported. This changes the porosity of the medium, thence, the local hydraulic conductivity, and leads to the development of erosional channels. Erosion is ultimately arrested due to the drop in the mean pressure gradient, while most of the flow occurs through the channels. We describe this using a minimal multiphase description of erosion where the volume fraction of the fluid, mobile, and immobile, grains change in space and time. Numerical solutions of the resulting initial boundary value problem yield results for the dynamics and morphology that are in qualitative agreement with our experiments. In addition to providing a basis for channelization in porous media, our study highlights how heterogeneity in porous media may arise from flow as a function of the erosion threshold.},

By contrast, on a regular square lattice, we find no signs of bistability or hysteretic behavior. This result suggests that the transition in two dimensions is rather continuous. Based on our numerical observations, we conjecture that the nature of the transition changes at the upper critical dimension (dc), from continuous (d{\textless}dc) to discontinuous (d{\textgreater}dc).},

Here we focus on the dynamical evolution of these systems. Our first-principle D=1,2 many-body numerical simulations (based on Newton's law) confirm the predictions obtained from the time-dependent solution of the nonlinear diffusion equation and show that the one-particle space distribution P(x,t) appears to follow a compact-support q-Gaussian form, with q=1-λ/D. We also calculate the velocity distributions P(vx,t), and, interestingly enough, they follow the same q-Gaussian form (apparently precisely for D=1, and nearly so for D=2). The satisfactory match between the continuum description and the molecular dynamics simulations in a more general, time-dependent framework neatly confirms the idea that the present dissipative systems indeed represent suitable applications of the q-generalized thermostatistical theory.},

Damage initiates inside spherical samples above the contact zone in a region where the circumferential stress field is tensile. Cracks initiated in this region grow to form meridional planes. If the collision energy exceeds a critical value which depends on the material's internal structure, cracks reach the sample surface resulting in fragmentation. We show that this primary fragmentation mechanism is very robust with respect to the internal structure of the material. For all configurations, a sharp transition from the damage to the fragmentation regime is observed, with smaller critical collision energies for crystalline samples. The mass distribution of the fragments follows a power law for small fragments with an exponent that is characteristic for the branching merging process of unstable cracks. Moreover this exponent depends only on the dimensionally of the system and not on the microstructure.},

At a given confining potential strength, the cluster size distribution takes the form of a power law. This regime corresponds to the situation in which the density at the center of the system approaches the critical percolation threshold. The analysis of the fractal dimension of the largest cluster frontier provides evidence that this regime is reminiscent of gradient percolation. By increasing further the confining potential, most of the particles coalesce in a giant cluster, and we observe a regime where the jump size distribution takes the form of a power law. The onset of this second regime is signaled by a maximum in the fluctuation of energy.},
